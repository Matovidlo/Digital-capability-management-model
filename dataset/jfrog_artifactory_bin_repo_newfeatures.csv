Binary R packages for Linux,RTFACT-24894,128470,New Feature,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,robertdj,robertdj,12/Feb/21 9:12 AM,16/Feb/21 5:02 AM,18/Feb/21 8:47 AM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,"*Description:*

The CRAN in Artifactory supports binary R packages for macOS and Windows, but not for Linux. Binary packages are much faster to install and for R in Docker images we need Linux packages. 

R package archives come in three flavors: ""tar.gz"" for source and binary Linux; ""zip"" for Windows; "".tgz"" for macOS. When uploading a package archive with the UI it detects that zip and .tgz files are binary and suggests putting them in the ""bin"" part of the CRAN. It does not detect if a tar.gz is the source or binary Linux. The DESCRIPTION file in the archive reveals if it is binary or source.

When using the REST API it is possible to POST a tar.gz archive to the ""bin"" part of the CRAN, but the location mirrors that of Windows/macOS: ""bin/<distro>/contrib/<r version>"" (e.g. ""bin/ubuntu/focal/contrib/4.0.1"").

However, for R on Linux to ""just work"" with the binary packages, we need an extra ""src/contrib"" in the path. (The current intermediate ""contrib"" is not needed.)

*Expected Beahvior:*

As an example, packages compiled with R version 4.0.1 on Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) should be located in ""bin/ubuntu/focal/4.0.1/src/contrib"" and in R the ""repos"" option should be ""<JFrog Artifactory URL>/bin/ubuntu/focal/4.0.1"". In this case, R will automatically detect that the packages are binary when they are downloaded.

As long as ""src/contrib"" is the last part of the folder, you can include additional folders in between.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact

Support basic authentication as SSO method in Artifactory 7,RTFACT-24761,127191,New Feature,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,dokaspar,dokaspar,01/Feb/21 10:21 AM,01/Feb/21 10:24 AM,18/Feb/21 8:48 AM,,7.12.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,"We are still using Artifactory 6 and are testing an upgrade to Artifactory 7.12.5, but it seems that SSO via basic authentication has been dropped in Artifactory 7. Would it be possible to bring this feature back?

In our current Artifactory 6 deployment, users are first authenticated on a company-internal proxy. When an authenticated user clicks on the 'Artifactory' link, the user credentials are sent to Artifactory using basic authentication and the user is transparently logged into Artifactory.

However, with Artifactory 7 this no longer works! Consider the following test to the /ui/auth/current endpoint, which returns details about the current user, such as the username. 

With Artifactory 6, the following command returns as JSON structure with my user details (and it returns ""Bad credentials"" if I enter the wrong password):
{noformat}
curl -u myLDAPuser --verbose --noproxy \* http://localhost:8081/artifactory/ui/auth/current
{noformat}
However, with Artifactory 7, the same command (this time to port 8082) always returns details for the 'anonymous' user (no matter if I provide correct or invalid credentials):
{noformat}
curl -u myLDAPuser --verbose --noproxy \* http://localhost:8082/ui/api/v1/ui/auth/current
{noformat}
Why was basic authenticaion dropped as a means to provide SSO to Artifactory and why is this nowhere documented?
 Would it be possible to bring back basic authentication as a SSO method?

A global replication feature can ease this process by offering the following:
 # Configure the source Artifactory instance(s)
 # Offer to automatically replicate to all repos in the destination instance on a same-name basis
 # Have an overall ""drag list"" of the configured replications/repos for an easier and quicker configuration & management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact

We need to automate a few business processes which require API endpoints that exist (as seen by Chrome dev tools) but are not formally exposed to end users. A summary of the endpoints and the use cases justifying their needs are below:
 * Ability to assign a custom license to an artifact

We make extensive use of watches and policies to ensure that no artifact is consumed that either a) contains an unknown license or b) does not contain a license. Some of these situations are expected for our use cases, and we’d like to automate the resolution of these violations so they do not pollute our alarming or reporting. The ability to assign a license to an artifact - including a custom license - via an API call would allow us to programmatically identify these situations and resolve them ourselves via automation. This assignment can already been done via the UI, but the volume of artifacts we consume (hundreds to thousands a day) makes manual resolution of these issues prohibitive.
 * Ability to fetch all known compliance licenses

We maintain an external repository of different licenses and our legal stance on their use (e.g., allowed for use, never allowed for use, discuss with legal, etc). This information is published to an internal developer website so they have a handy, developer-friendly way to determine if a component they wish to use is likely to be approved or denied. We populate this external repository from a variety of sources (e.g., spdx, osi), but are currently unable to reflect all configurable licenses in Artifactory because the API endpoint is currently private.

Adding these two endpoints would go along way in easing the operational burden of consuming your product. Right now, these are very challenging gaps from our end and we don’t yet have good line of site as to how we might address these needs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact

 We want to block a *specific version of module* and do not want it to appear in the pip search. We added this in the exclude pattern still that does not help.

E.g. say to block setuptools ver 50.0.0,  added  the following in the exclude path  ""excludesPattern:**/setuptools-50.0.0*"" 
 still it shows the blocked version  in 
 [http://<base_url>/artifactory/api/pypi/upstream-pypi/simple/setuptools/

Combining multiple repositories under a single folder in artifactory,RTFACT-24230,120831,New Feature,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,nishant.kansal@ukg.com,nishant.kansal@ukg.com,14/Dec/20 8:02 AM,14/Dec/20 7:16 PM,18/Feb/21 8:48 AM,,,,,,,,,,,Artifactory,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,"*Requirement Statement*:

-----------------------------

Our requirement is related to the clubbing of different repositories under a single folder in the artifactory.

E.g.; we have unique Gradle repositories (A, B, and C). We want to club them together under a single folder/repository for the ease of user's readability.

Like:

*Group-Kronos*
 * A
 * B
 * C

If we are using a virtual repository concept, then it will pick the artifacts under the repositories but not the repository names. We would like to refrain from copying all the content from A/ to A/A/ that will allow the packages to be visible under the Repository name.

Can you please consider this feature to provide a generic folder level clubbing? It will of big help to arrange repositories in artifactory group wise.

An analogy to this feature is the Jenkins Folder plugin that provides a unique namespace to the pipelines under it yet clubs them under the same folder.

 

Best regards

However, with the introduction of package signing, [nuget.org|http://nuget.org/] started signing packages with a repository certificate and on a regular basis seems to be re-signing the packages with a new certificate. That means, that two copies of the same package downloaded from nuget.org at different points in time, might have a different hash even though they contain the same content (only the signature embedded in the package has changed).

Therefore we can't check easily if two packages are the same.

NuGet introduced the concept of a “[content hash|https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/Nupkg-Metadata-File]” as a hash value over the contents of a package (excluding the signature file) This content hash will not change when the package is resigned but only if the actual content changes.

It took several days to isolate, so warrants raising this issue. 

We start with the following base image:
{code:java}
FROM docker.bintray.io/jfrog/artifactory-cpp-ce:7.6.2{code}
We then bootstrap our custom docker image with this simple .sh script to set the `urlBase` setting:
{code:java}
#!/bin/bash
set -eo pipefailcurl -m 5 -f -X PATCH \
-u ${DEMO_ART_CREDS_USR}:${DEMO_ART_CREDS_PSW} \
-H 'Content-Type: application/yaml' \
http://localhost:8082/artifactory/api/system/configuration \
-d '
urlBase: http://artifactory-training:8082
'
{code}
The REST API call is successful, but when we start a container from the image, it presents this error, which we believe is completely misleading since there is obviously no HA configuration made anywhere:

 

Of note, this example uses the `yaml` API, but the results are the same when calling the REST API endpoint:

http://localhost:8082/artifactory/api/system/configuration/baseUrl

{code}
 

 

Through testing, we found that the Artifactory first-run wizard rejects the URL shown earlier with an error, stating that the string `/artifactory` is invalid/illegal in the URL.  To workaround the issue, we changed the URL in the script and the HA-related error has gone away. 

It seems that the REST API does not perform the same data validation as the GUI. If this is expected behavior, that is understandable, however there's more. 

We were also allowed to set the invalid/illegal set the Base URL field via the GUI under the main Artifactory Settings area. The field validation should definitely be applied there. 

So, in summary, it seems likely that the only improvement that can be made here is to add the same `baseURL` field validation in main settings which exists under the first-run wizard.

As you can see, we're using the yaml configuration API which is supposed to suppress the first-run wizard, but it doesn't. 

 

If we add the following yaml snippet to the body, it DOES suppress the first-run wizard properly:

 
{code:java}
localRepositories: #Local repositories configuration     
    conan-tmp: #The local repository name
        type: conan #The package type

I am having issue while creating repositories via REST API. I am following json format given by JFrog - [https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Repository+Configuration+JSON]

 

The default repository layout when created by REST API and no values passed for ""repoLayoutRef"". It creates the repo layout as ""maven-2-default""

 

But when we create it from JFrog GUI, we don't require to select the layout and it choose by itself as per the repository type e.g.

nuget repo type has nuget-default layout

gradle repo type has gradle-default layout

maven repo type has maven-2-default

 

I can change script logic and pass static values, but concern is if JFrog release new repository layout like maven-3-default, we still be keep using maven-2-default without notifying.

 

Is there any way or parameter which works the way we create repositories from JFrog GUI, where we don't select any layout and pick by itself the latest available layout like maven has 2 versions but it picks by defauld maven-2.

 

I am in middle of creating script to onboard JFrog repo, permissions, your early response will help.

 

Thanks,

Currently artifactory has a authorisation mechanism that uses Username and Password or Username and API key or Username and Accesstoken.

All the authorisation mechanisms are dependent of a User. Access tokens has a transient user feature but that is only available for Admin users. When a user leaves the project or organisation, the automation that the user handled may start to fail as user might have used his/her credentials of Jfrog.

Can we have access to Artifactory via Azure SPN. We can assign users to a single SPN. So instead of using User dependent credentials, a team can use the SPN in common for all the common activities done on automation and other stuffs.

Is it possible to have this feature in Artifactory? It would be really good if we have this !

we are currently implementing artifact promotion into out development pipeline to improve reliability and security of what artifacts are going into prod.

To that end we wanted to lock down from where an artifact is promoted from, for example any artifact can be promoted from it default repo into *lockdown-dev* only artifact in lockdown-dev can be promoted into *lockdown-test*, and finally only artifacts from lockdown-test can promoted *lockdown-prod*.


we would request a feature be made available to achieve this for example, having a setting on the repo which you can tick to enable then add repos to a list of ""acceptable promotions repo""

Having the above setup, we could then run  ""{{build-promote"" with the optionally tag ""}}{{--source-repo=$SOURCE_REPOSITORY""}}
{{}}

with ""{{$SOURCE_REPOSITORY"" }}Equalling one of the approve repos.

We've confirmed with ticket 141612 that there is currently no way to do this in artifactory.

 ","on Prem Environment.

promotion access has been limited to service accounts that have been implemented into CI/CD process.

This stop promotions outside of the CI/CD process but unfortunately does not stop someone doing something dodgy inside the CI/CD process.

prevent internal package squatting on public registries,RTFACT-23049,106933,New Feature,In Progress,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,2 - Critical,,Oleksis,fergal,fergal,05/Aug/20 9:50 AM,18/Feb/21 7:10 AM,18/Feb/21 8:48 AM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,,,,,,,,"After emailing support I was told to raise a feature request here.

I've recently been made aware of a problem where it's possible for an attacker to make a new version of an internal artifact on a public registry, which users or CI systems could download when looking for the latest version.
  
 I am vulnerable to this because I use virtual repositories which have a local repository for internal artifacts, and a remote repository for public artifacts. Previously I interpreted the docs at [https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Virtual+Repositories] to mean that local repositories were always preferred. I now understand that remote repositories can be used to get a new version of an artifact which is in a local repository. I see the section in the docs about using Excludes Patterns to make sure internal artifacts aren't fetched from remotes, but this would require constantly updating the patterns with new internal artifacts.
  
 Can I ask for a feature where if any version of an artifact exists in a local repository in a virtual repository, the remote repositories in the virtual repository are not used to find new versions. It could be a checkbox when configuring a virtual repository. This would prevent the entire class of vulnerability without further configuration, and would work in a way which is easy to explain to end users.

For example, your organization may have its own artifacts which are hosted both internally in a local repository, but also in a remote repository. For any reason (for example, optimal performance or security concerns), you would want these artifacts to be accessed from the local repository rather than from the remote one. To enforce this policy, you can define a virtual repository called ""remote-repos"" which includes the full set of remote repositories accessed by your organization, and then specify an Excludes Pattern with your organization's groupID. in this way, any attempt to access your internal artifact from a remote repository would be rejected.

You can fully automate the process of adding Exclude Pattern for specific artifact/s.

If, however, I build a custom image from a base image that has foreign layers and push it to a local registry, artifactory will not fetch and cache those foreign layers in response to a request to pull the custom image. Interestingly, if those layers have already been cached as a result of pulling the base image through the remote registry, Artifactory will server the cached layers in response to a request to pull the custom image.

The problem with the workaround of pulling the images through the remote registry first is that it is very brittle. It is only good as long as the layers stay cached, so you can't enable any type of cache cleanup, which can lead to space concerns in the long run

f2e52ef54166788ae29b5b4eec6fdb9cd580acab {code}
However, we cannot get the same checksum value of the packages from the source registry using the remote repository unless that package is cached. This breaks the working of a tool called ""Kops"". This tool ""Kops"" will first get the checksum value of a package from the source registry and then download it.

 

For example, when we create a generic remote repository pointing to ""*https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/*"" and try to get the checksum value of any file which is available in the source googleapis registry fails with 404.

 
{code:java}
curl -uadmin:Password http://localhost:8081/artifactory/googleapi/release/v1.18.2/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl.sha256
{
 ""errors"" : [ {
 ""status"" : 404,
 ""message"" : ""Checksum not found for release/v1.18.2/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl""
 } ]
}{code}
Once the package ""*kubectl*"" is downloaded and it is cached in Artifactory, the above curl to get the checksum will be successful.
{code:java}
curl -uadmin:Password http://localhost:8081/artifactory/googleapi/release/v1.18.2/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl -o kubectl

curl -uadmin:Password http://localhost:8081/artifactory/googleapi/release/v1.18.2/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl.sha256
6ea8261b503c6c63d616878837dc70b758d4a3aeb9996ade8e83b51aedac9698{code}
This breaks the way the tool ""Kops"" works. Also, whenever there is already the checksum value available in the source registry, Artifactory should take it from there, if the package is not locally available.

 
{code:java}
For instance this binary: https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.18.2/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
also has this checksum file published: https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.18.2/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl.sha256
{code}
So if the checksum file is already available for a specific package in the source registry as above, Artifactory should fetch it from the source if the package is not locally cached.

The packagist.org registry scans the GitHub repository and creates a version for tags that are present in GitHub.

You can determine the order in which the data is written between the zones and you can set the method for establishing the free space when writing to the mounts in the neighboring zones. 

""""""

The problem is that when we set lenientLimit value, it applies to how many shards are down, not to how many zones are down. 

The goal is to be able to set a value for how many zones are ""OK"" to be down and still allow writes. This comes from the main purpose of cross-zone sharding, which is to maintain redundancy in different zones, while still allowing some of them to be down.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact

When we capture that file and its values in Puppet the first time, it was a surprise to find that when the artifactory service was restarted that the DB password was then encrypted, which required recapturing the values again. Not only that, since we have an HA setup, the password is now different on each node. This is totally unhelpful for us. If someone is able to compromise access to Artifactory, we have other major issues. Operationally with Puppet it is more difficult to sustain the management of n passwords where n is the number of HA nodes in our cluster. We already have systems in place to keep the DB passwords encrypted and placed on the EC2 with Puppet. We don't need it obfuscated and different on each separate HA node. We would have a similar system in place in k8s if we were ever to migrate our Artifactory implementation there as well.

 * {{organization}} - give permissions to every user that belongs to a specific GitHub organization.
 * {{organization*team}} - give permissions to a specific GitHub team of a GitHub organization. Notice that organization and team are separated by an asterisk ({{*}}).

Story
* As JFrog, when a customer performs download using an RTF signed URL, I'd like to be able to validate they are using the GET HTTP method, so that they are not able to perform a security exploit by using the POST method 

h3. Scope
* Serve signed URL download only if method is GET

h3. Background
* Artifactory supports generating a signed URL using the api/signed/url end point. the following story refers to the scenario where the customer had already generated a signed URL using this API, and now calls the signed URL to download the content. While the API for *generating* a signed URL is used using the POST method,  the *download* itself should occur using the GET method (i.e. call the signed URL with a GET). In case the customer is able to use the signed URL using POST (i.e. if we don't validate the method when the signed URL is called), this may be exploited by attackers. 

h3. Acceptance Criteria 
* In case a customer attempts to perform a download using a JFrog signed URL, while using an HTTP method other than GET, the download should fail.

While doing some routine maintenance we discovered that Artifactory does not ever clear out HA nodes that have failed their heartbeats, even after long periods of time.

I assume this behavior is because Artifactory was originally designed to run on bare metal/VMs that were expected to be durable, but on Kubernetes our nodes are containers that are constantly getting restarted, shifted around, terminated, etc and so there is a large buildup of nodes that have failed their heartbeats and are never going to come back, which leaves us with a large amount of cruft.

Speaking with JFrog support, it appears that the only way to clean these up is by manually deleting the old nodes via the UI, which is not an enjoyable experience (I'm currently staring at 19 pages worth of these dead nodes on our production cluster, for reference). Furthermore the documentation I found regarding deleting HA nodes mentions the possibility of these old nodes causing problems in the cluster overall: https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF6X/Managing+the+HA+Cluster#ManagingtheHACluster-RemovinganUnusedNode

My ask is to have a garbage collector added to Artifactory that can be configured to clean up nodes that have failed their heartbeat over a certain threshold. As an example, I could enable this new garbage collector on our Artifactory cluster to clean up any HA nodes that have failed their heartbeats for more than 24 hours and have the collector run once per day on a schedule.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact

I work for Hitachivantara and we have 6 artifactories, spread around different locations (4 in the US, 1 in Portugal and 1 AWS).

This artifactories have multiple repositories that are replicated between the artifactories, so that development teams located on those regions can access faster the necessary repositories.

Besides the window in Mission Control (for each artifactory configured there) to see how the replications are doing there is no other way to know about them all. Or to see if something failed we will need to go trough each individual artifactory log to see if an error has occurred.

It would be nice the have a way to configure sending warnings (via email for example) each time a replication fails to execute. And also to have them displayed in Mission control next to each replication.

This works well, but there is a fundamental difference between the remote PHP repository and a local PHP repository.

 

For local PHP repositories, Artifactory requires that a ""composer.version"" Artifactory Property be present. Without it, local PHP metadata will not be calculated. This metadata property needs to be set to the correct package version.

 

The problem is that PHP artifacts copied from a remote repository to a local repository will be missing this critical property. It cannot be filled in with a constant value, as the property is tied to the package's version.

 

For example, composer.version=1.0 means the package will always be ""1.0"" and will cause version mismatch issues.

 

Artifactory needs to be able to automatically calculate this metadata property on cached remote artifacts, otherwise User Plugins such as the remoteBackup plugin will not work.

Make SAML AuthnRequest namespace configurable ,RTFACT-21018,88025,New Feature,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,paulp,paulp,06/Jan/20 8:08 PM,15/Feb/21 9:38 AM,18/Feb/21 8:48 AM,,6.0.0,6.13.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,"Currently, Artifactory uses org.opensaml.saml library to generate SAML auth request and the AuthnRequest namespace is hardcoded to be saml2p.

Example:

<saml2p:AuthnRequest
        xmlns:saml2p=""urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol""
        AssertionConsumerServiceURL=""BLOCKEDbusiness[.]jfrog[.]org:8080/artifactory/webapp/saml/loginResponse""BLOCKED;

            >business.jfrog.org
    </saml2:Issuer>
</saml2p:AuthnRequest>

This will cause issue if the IDP is an ADFS 3.0 server as it is expecting a samlp namespace. 

When artifactory send this authnrequest to ADFS server, the request redirects to the IDP and an error message is given with no details.

If we directly login on the IDP server and redirect to Artifactory, the SAML SSO is working. The result is that the user can not use the SAML login icon on Artifactory to do the saml login.

The ""saml2p"" namespace is hardcoded right now and we should make this property configurable. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact

Artifactory PHP packages Composer Performance Issues,RTFACT-20967,87399,New Feature,Pause,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,3 - High,,volodymyrs,Nimerb,Nimerb,30/Dec/19 2:41 PM,15/Feb/21 7:33 AM,18/Feb/21 8:48 AM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13,PB_Done,,,,,,,"When resolving PHP package, the dependencies takes multiple small HTTP requests to Artifactory about every single package that the project uses.

The above does not occur when working with *packagist.org* or *packages.drupal.org*.

This is happening because the composer endpoint provided by Artifactory does not provide the *provider-includes* and *providers-url* information from its primary *packages.json* endpoint.

The reason for providing the *provider-includes* and *providers-url* information is to help composer ahead of time in as few requests as possible to know what dependencies are available on that repository. That way it does not need to check if the repository contains that dependency or not.

By lacking the *provider-includes* information in Artifactory, composer is required to make a single HTTP request for every dependency in the project, using the *providers-lazy-url* that can only search for a single project at a time.

The difference can be seen in the *packages.json* endpoint between Artifactory and other Packagist-style Composer repositories:

https://<ART_URL>/api/composer/drupal8/packages.json contents:
{
 ""packages"" : {
 },
 ""search"" : ""https://<ART_URL>/api/composer/drupal8/search.json?q=%query%&type=%type%"",
 ""providers-lazy-url"" : ""https://<ART_URL>/api/composer/drupal8/p/%package%.json""
}


https://packages.drupal.org/8/packages.json contents:
{
 ""notify-batch"": ""/8/downloads"",
 ""providers-url"": ""/8/%package%$%hash%.json"",
 ""search"": ""/8/search.json?s=%query%"",
 ""provider-includes"": {
 ""drupal/provider-2019-4$%hash%.json"": {
 ""sha256"": ""a5360b5f048dd93d51b10e34c859e2e889dec2a66fe3fb4fd18d7b11940271bc""
 },
 ...
 }
}


https://packagist.org/packages.json contents:
{
 ""packages"": [],
 ""notify"": ""https://packagist.org/downloads/%package%"",
 ""notify-batch"": ""https://packagist.org/downloads/"",
 ""providers-url"": ""/p/%package%$%hash%.json"",
 ""metadata-url"": ""/p2/%package%.json"",
 ""search"": ""https://packagist.org/search.json?q=%query%&type=%type%"",
 ""provider-includes"": {
 ""p/provider-2013$%hash%.json"": {
 ""sha256"": ""01da343f74070352c615b1a1564a4afcfeff77c9df15c9b08470700dc0d52ebf""
 },
 ...
 }
}


The contents of one of the provider-includes files from packages.drupal.org shows that it contains simply a partial list of the dependencies/projects available on that repository, along with a corresponding SHA-256 hash, which is then plugged into the previous provides-url from the packages.json endpoint to fetch the latest on that dependency:
{
 ""providers"": {
 ""drupal/ctools"": {
 ""sha256"": ""5cb7254c2cecb3a1e0788b5e406e9db86d322b3ae3ad7ebc46ce9a75a0ce7c4d""
 },
 ""drupal/ctools_views"": {
 ""sha256"": ""d281616b6acc5044ce6a5e2cb71bd62e17d342b738347da1a4b1515ba7465d02""
 },
 ...
 }
}

 

For example to fetch the latest information about drupal/ctools from packages.drupal.org, we just need to make an HTTP request to


https://packages.drupal.org/8/drupal/ctools$5cb7254c2cecb3a1e0788b5e406e9db86d322b3ae3ad7ebc46ce9a75a0ce7c4d.json

and Composer only needs to store the hash and then will know if the project has been updated and it needs to re-download the project information.

Artifactory needs to provide this provider-includes and providers-url information in its Composer endpoint, it would help speed up any composer update calls that use Artifactory.",,,,,,,,,,,RTFACT-20704,RTFACT-15188,RTFACT-20823,,,,,,JFUI-5352,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact

The alternative solution is moving the source path of the artifacts to the destination path. (please let me know if this is not atomic operation) The problem is ""move"" API will place the source path to the destination path if the destination path exists. User has to delete the destination path before moving, but in parallel build mode, other build may move artifacts after my build deletes the destination path. The problem can be solved by supporting replacement option in ""move"" API, which deletes all in destination path before moving.

Any user with write/deploy permissions shouldn't be able to just go change things in the repository settings. If you want to give someone permissions to manage the repos they have manage permissions on, then the permissions for ""manage"" need to be separated out into user permissions and repo admin access. Making someone an admin over their repo just because they use it seems odd.

However, I do agree that the permissions for repos are a bit strange. I'm going to throw in another ticket. For example, if you have manage permissions you can change users and groups that have access to the repo. This seems a bit much permissions if you want to give someone the ability to just recalculate the metadata. I believe the recalculate permission should be part of annotate as it is already billed as: ""Allows annotating artifacts and folders with metadata and properties."" For instance: https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-CalculateNuGetRepositoryMetadata this should be under annotate or a new permission level, not manage.","12/Feb/20 11:05 PM;mcarlton;Related ticket: https://www.jfrog.com/jira/browse/RTFACT-21250","18/Aug/20 11:19 PM;mcarlton;Duplicate of: https://www.jfrog.com/jira/browse/RTFACT-7253.

This request is related to the sizing of the view window in Artifactory. From the repository, if we open any log file or a text file, it opens in a pop-up window. This window is non-resizable. This is a request to make it resizable. If the file is a bigger one the view is not very good. Hence it would be good if the window can be made resizable, That will help a lot.

Any news on supporting this CDN via Artifactory?","01/Oct/20 1:31 PM;eugene_dudnyk;Upvoting for this feature request.

Additional context from my side:

With CDN feature request, it is expected that with CocoaPods CDN Artifactory also does the proxying of both internal (from the intranet) and external (from CocoaPods CDN) dependencies, and performs caching (in the same way like it does now for Android with Maven repository layout).

In the Artifactory [documentation|https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/CocoaPods+Repositories] on currently supported CocoaPods repository layout it is mentioned that the layout does caching for pods that are served by the author in the format of `tar.gz` archive, while with vanilla CocoaPods the most of the libraries are actually just cloned via git, and rarely are distributed as `tar.gz` archives. So, with the request to introduce CDN, it would be expected also to solve the issue of caching of libraries that are served from git repos in the corporate intranet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please provide a REST service to copy / move files in bulk,RTFACT-20423,82398,New Feature,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,francois.ritaly,francois.ritaly,24/Oct/19 3:12 PM,07/Nov/19 11:46 AM,18/Feb/21 8:48 AM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,"This JIRA is an enhancement request to the Artifactory REST API.

The current Artifactory REST API features a service named [Copy Item|https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-CopyItem] to copy a given item (either a file or a folder) to another location in Artifactory.

When using the service to copy a folder, the request will only return after the copy completes which makes sense from a user point-of-view. This time can vary based on the number of items in the folder being copied.

I'm currently implementing an automation to create a snapshot of a repository which implies to copy the full repository content somewhere else in Artifactory. Some of the repositories I need to snapshot can contain up to 26 000 files. 

The sheer amount of files to copy means that I'm hitting the limits of the current Copy Item REST service. I ran a test. The copy eventually completes after 18 minutes (thanks to 6 parallel copy threads) but as expected, those 26 000 copy requests sent to Artifactory induce a high DB load and a huge network traffic. In terms of performance, this is a worse case scenario.

I tried Improving things by having Artifactory perform whole folder copies: instead of issuing 26000 file copy requests, the snapshot would sent 5000 file copy requests and 25 folder copy requests. I'm not going to elaborate on how this works but it turns out that this solution doesn't really work because of the metadata files: when performing a folder copy, if the folder contains some metadata files (i.e. ""repodata"") and the user doesn't have permissions to overwrite them in the destination, Artifactory is going to throw an error because the user lacks delete / overwrite permissions. One solution would be to tell Artifactory ""Copy this folder over there but skip all the metadata"", which is not possible.

My need could be addressed by featuring a new REST service to perform a set of copy / move operations in a transactional way. This would provide a scalable version of the ""Copy Item"" / ""Move Item"" current service.

The new service could be invoked by sending a POST request to ""/api/batch"" with a JSON payload with the following structure:

{noformat}
{
    ""operations"": [
        {
            ""from"": ""/repo/dir1/dir2/file.txt"",
            ""to"": ""/another-repo/dir1/dir2/file.txt"",
            ""type"": ""copy""
        },
        {       
            ""from"": ""/yet-another-repo/file3.txt"",
            ""to"": ""/another-repo/dir1/dir2/file4.txt"",
            ""type"": ""copy""
        }
    ]     
}
{noformat}

where:
* ""from"" denotes the source location of the item to copy / move
* ""to"" denotes the target location where to copy / move the item
* ""type"" denotes the type of operation to perform. Expected values: ""copy"" or ""move"".

The items should be copied / moved in the same DB transaction to ensure that the process is transactional and performant.

The service should return a HTTP 200 (OK) if the operation succeeds or a HTTP 4xx if the update fails.

Note: I'm thinking that the service could also be extended to cover item deletions as in the following example.

{noformat}
{
    ""operations"": [
        {
            ""from"": ""/repo/dir1/dir2/file.txt"",
            ""to"": ""/another-repo/dir1/dir2/file.txt"",
            ""type"": ""copy""
        },
        {       
            ""from"": ""/yet-another-repo/file3.txt"",
            ""to"": ""/another-repo/dir1/dir2/file4.txt"",
            ""type"": ""copy""
        },
        {       
            ""location"": ""/yet-another-repo/file.txt"",
            ""type"": ""delete""
        }
    ]     
}
{noformat}

Having this new service would remove the limitations of the current Copy Item service.

I would like to request the ability to Deny specific users / groups access to specific repositories.

This would allow for global permissions to be applied, but then restricted down if needed on a repo by repo basis with minimal changes to the global perms.

 

Eg I need to stop anonymous access to 2 out of 100 repo's , it would be simpler to just deny access to the specific repos for that user. Otherwise we need to change the default Anything permissions group, when adding a repo remember to add it to that group etc etc.

 

THis would also cater for abuse scenarios when a specific user could be locked out from that specific repo for  a period of time

We've the same feature request.

You used (Artifactory) :
{code:java}
<ns2:NameIDFormat>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified</ns2:NameIDFormat> {code}
In my case, I can overide this NameID, with a relying party profile for Artifactory SP in my IDP configuration. (@Patrick, if you've the control of the idp configuration, you can do like this)
{code:java}
bean parent=""SAML2.SSO""
      p:nameIDFormatPrecedence=""urn:oid:1.1.1.1.1"" /> {code}
where urn:oid:1.1.1.1.1 is your custom employeeID attribute.

But, in order to simplify most SAML IDP admin, and all organizations

i think you could considered to introduce like you do with the user's email attribute in the Saml configuration panel, all standard fields and associate saml mapping field :
 * username
 * firstname
 * lastname

Best regards.

Artifactory AQL/REST Get Artifacts and Versions,RTFACT-20309,81026,New Feature,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,marcel.gredler,marcel.gredler,10/Oct/19 8:15 AM,04/Dec/19 7:21 AM,18/Feb/21 8:48 AM,,6.10.2,6.12.2,6.13.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,AQL,Artifactory,REST,,,,,"Currently it is possible to retrieve artifacts per AQL or REST-Api.
* Retrieving it per AQL allows to retrieve the meta-artifacts, within which the Artifact+Version information is available, or retrieve the information from properties (e.g. as it is the case for docker-images)
* Retrieving it per REST returns the actual artifacts path, which may not contain the meta-information (artifact-name, version, all versions, etc) or be usable to retrieve version information

All versions for an artifact can be retrieved through the meta-artifacts (e.g. maven-metadata.xml) or REST (the artifact-name is required, which is not returned through REST artifact search).
* This search returns the version associated with an artifact, but does not include the path to the artifacts behind this version.

Because of all this, should you have a use-case that requires a list of all artifacts, their versions and paths towards these versions, then you may have to use a combination of multiple AQL and REST calls - only becoming even more should a DELETE based on artifact+version be added.

Therefore it is better to query the meta-artifacts of all artifacts within a repository and parse these to build your context. Be warned that this can be tedious if you use many different package-types, as some have XML-files, some require properties-querying and some use JSON.


----
Instead of all of this it would be better if there were a REST endpoint that returns the following meta-information of all artifacts (or artifacts beneath a certain path) within a repository:
* Artifact-Name
* Path to meta-artifact
* Artifact-Versions
* For each version
** The path to the version-folder / version-artifact

With this it would be easy to get an overview of the artifacts and versions and easily run additional GET queries or a DELETE.

NPM dependency metadata caching,RTFACT-20082,78407,New Feature,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,micah.goldbaum,micah.goldbaum,09/Sep/19 1:14 PM,10/Sep/19 6:51 PM,18/Feb/21 8:48 AM,,,,,,,,,,,NPM,Remote Repository ,,,,,,13,,,,,,,,"With npm remote repos, we are finding the following use case with dependencies between packages ending up with an error message during builds. 

Background: 
 * We are publishing multiple packages directly to the public npm registry.
 * We do not want to publish to both the public registry and the local Artifactory instance.
 * We needed to increase the value of the Metadata Retrieval Cache Period because we were making to many requests to the public registry from Artifactory.

Summary of problem:
Development group releases a large volume of packages with new versions that depend on each other at the latest version. As the meta data (package.json) for packages trickles into Artifactory (because of the expiration of Metadata Cache), the dependencies which are pointing to the latest version aren't resolving because Artifactory hasn't updated the dependencies meta data yet.
 
Example:
Package A v1.0.0 depends on Package B v1.0.0
 
Public NPM contains:
Package A v1.0.0
Package B v1.0.0
 
Artifactory contains:
Package A v1.0.0
Package B v1.0.0
 
Package B v1.1.0 is released
Package A is updated to depend on B v1.1.0
Package A v 1.1.0 is released
 
Public NPM contains:
Package A v1.1.0
Package B v1.1.0
 
Package A meta data expires and Artifactory updates metadata for Package A
Package B meta data has not expired and remains the same.
 
Artifactory contains:
Package A v1.1.0
Package B v1.0.0
 
Npm install run using Artifactory and fails when Package B v1.1.0 is not found.
 

It seems like there needs to be an additional query to the remote repo for NPM dependencies that are not found in Artifactory.  We want to avoid decreasing the time for the metadata cache retrieval.  Can Artifactory handle this a different way for these inter dependencies where if a dependency is not found in Artifactory that it can force a lookup to the remote.  Or when caching an artifact, search through and look for these dependencies and if there are any versions missing from the local cache then also cache those packages from the source remote site.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact

Allow Artifactory to Serve Go Modules Vanity URLs,RTFACT-20033,78136,New Feature,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,eliom,eliom,03/Sep/19 9:07 PM,16/Feb/21 10:36 AM,18/Feb/21 8:48 AM,,,,,,,,,,,Go,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,"When users have a module using a custom module path, they need to create a Vanity URL server to translate the module name to the actual source location.

Artifactory users should be able to use it as a Vanity URL server so they do not need to set up an additional component to resolve their modules.

*+Additional Details+*

When you create a Go module, the path you declare in your go.mod file to identify it is used by the Go client to reach out to the source. That is why most of the Go modules we see out there look like github.com/<ORG>/<REPO_NAME>.

So what if I want to name my module something else, let's say myorg.com/mymodule. Somehow, when the Go client is trying to fetch it, I need to point out where the source content actually is. That is why vanity urls were introduced. Under https://myorg.com?go-get=1 I need to serve some html content with meta tags that have information about where the source code lives. The response for that request could be something like this:

<html>
<meta name=""go-import"" content=""myorg.com/mymodule git https://github.com/myorg/mymodule"">
</html>

So for my module to work properly, I need a web server listening for that request under my custom path and serving this content.

I think the ask here is, since customers also want to use Artifactory to proxy and cache those modules, if it is possible to avoid having to setup another webserver just to serve those meta tags and use Artifactory for that as well, by setting up some mapping rules in the format Module Path --> Source Location and pointing the DNS rules for those custom module paths to Artifactory.

One important thing to keep in mind is that vanity urls are ignored by the Go client when you have the GOPROXY environment variable set, since the client will delegate to the proxy to serve the content. However, they are still going to be needed by the proxy so it can find and fetch the content before serving it.

Another important thing is, if all consumers are resolving your modules from Artifactory (GOPROXY set) you don't need vanity urls at all as long as you push your modules to Artifactory directly. Even though this should be the recommended approach, we still see people wanting to proxy their source repositories, which makes vanity urls needed.

Also, I'm not sure if Artifactory knows how to use vanity urls as a client at this moment. I was trying to resolve sigs.k8s.io/yaml@v1.2.0 using a remote pointing to GitHub and it did not work.

Here is some good reading about the vanity urls:

Hey Guys,
 
I'm getting 409's, from artifactory and it would reduce the back and forth between a mere mortal, and the artifactory admins if the error specified what the current settings are.
 
For example:
 
[409] {
  ""errors"" : [ {
    ""status"" : 409,
    ""message"" : ""The repository 'release-local' rejected the artifact 'release-local:com/allen/lib/1.0.4/allen-lib-1.0.4.jar' due to its include/exclude pattern settings.""
  } ]
 
It would be better to have:
 
[409] {

Azure AD returns a token and Artifactory will use it in order to get a connection to MSSQL.

In short, I am looking to use the following regex:

I want to store artifacts in the following way inside the repo

dir1/dir2/dir3/\{rest of directory structure}

I want to search items based on their path. I want to use wildcards when matching on the three top-level directories names. So if my items are stored under:
foo/bar/123/
I want to be able to search for:
oo/ar/23
fo/ba/12
foo/bar/123
and get this as a result but I want to also be able to not give it any values and get it as a result like searching for */*/*.
At the same time I may have the following directory structures in the repo:
dir1/dir2/dir3/foo/bar/123
foo/dir2/dir3/bar/123

In these cases I don't want these to show up in my results when I'm searching for foo/bar/123. In other words, I only care about the three top-level folders in the repo but for those three I want to search based on wildcards even if I don't know their exact names.

I've come up with the following regular expression to match path on:

[^\/]*\{dir1-searchvalue}[^\/]*/[^\/]*\{dir2-searchvalue}[^\/]*/[^\/]*\{dir3-searchvalue}[^\/]*

Remote repo for replicating Symfony Flex repositories,RTFACT-19746,76078,New Feature,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,benedicte.garcia,benedicte.garcia,25/Jul/19 3:35 PM,18/Sep/20 7:50 AM,18/Feb/21 8:48 AM,,,,,,,,,,,PHP,Remote Repository ,,,,,,5,repository,,,,,,,"Hello,


Due to security reasons, our servers doesn't have access to the Internet. Then, we use our Artifactory to download and keep in cache a lot of packages from external sources.


Some of our developpers came with a new need : remote repositories for Symfony 4, which is a problem beceause it uses 2 different kinds of repositories to download packages for installations and update :
 * php composer, as before
 * Symfony Flex which provides recipes and packages with a different way of doing it : https://flex.symfony.com/




After a few tests, it appears that Artifactory can't handle Symfony Flex packages. Without it, we can't install properly our Symfony 4, because when the installation tries to contact the flex server through Artifactory, it doesn't find the requested files.


Here is how to reproduce it :

In your Artifactory :
 * Create remote repo type php composer connected to Packagist (old Symfony Repo) : [https://packagist.org|https://packagist.org/]
 * Create remote type type php composer or generic (tried both and non worked) connected to flex server : [https://flex.symfony.com|https://flex.symfony.com/]


On your testing machine :
 * install php composer : [https://getcomposer.org/download/]
 * disable internet access from your test machine or you will not see the error to contact Symfony Flex
 * Configure composer remote repositories like this :
{{~/.composer/config.json}}
{{{}}
{{    ""repositories"": [}}
{{        \{""type"": ""composer"", ""url"": ""https://artifactory-principale.enedis.fr/artifactory/api/composer/<your packagist repo>""},}}
{{        \{""packagist"": false}}}
{{    ]}}
{{}}}
 * If your repo is not public, do not forget to configure also your ~/.composer/auth.json with the informations provided by Artifactory
 * In specific folder for installing symfony do this command to install an empty symfony : {{composer create-project symfony/website-skeleton --no-install}}
 * It will download and install all files from packagist but should provide you an error related to symfony flex
 * Go in folder website-skeleton
 * Edit composer.json and add these lines at the end of the file :

{{""extra"": {}}{{        }}

{{""symfony"": {}}{{            }}

{{""allow-contrib"": false,}}{{            }}

{{""require"": ""4.3.*"",}}{{            }}

{{""endpoint"": ""Your repo connected to Flex URL""}}{{        }}

{{}}}{{    }}

{{}}}
 * Then do a composer update


You should have 404 errors because it couldn't find requested files to finish the update.

I found this project on Github to achieve this but it's still in developpement and we can't take that risk : https://github.com/sfeni/flexsrv


Can you add this feature to Artifactory ?

Finding/Business Risk
An insufficiently long password history allows authorized users to reuse old passwords with greater ease and frequency.  This more readily enables brute-force attacks and password predictability, elevating the attacker’s chances to gain account access.



Failed Test/Vulnerability Description
Applications track the password history so that the password setting mechanism ensures users set unique passwords different from the limited history of the user’s previously used passwords.  If prior password history isn’t tracked for comparison, or if the tracked history consists of a consistently small set of prior passwords, then a user will be able to more easily revert to an old password in a short period of time.  For internal users whose password settings are not CMS EUA-managed, the password policy must meet ARS 3.1 guidelines.



Actual Test Results
On the password reset page for an “internal” user (not LDAP-issued) account, the user was able to specify a new password that matched the old password.  The new credentials were accepted by the application.

Multiple internal user accounts were discovered in IMP.   However, the majority of JFrog user accounts in PROD are managed by EUA password policy aside from one internal admin account on PROD, and only other admins have the ability to view the list of user accounts and usernames to determine which users are actually internal accounts.



Recommended Corrective Action
Configure the application to prohibit password reuse for a minimum of six (6) generations for internal JFrog user accounts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact

Similar to how we assign users permissions per repository, it would be beneficial if we are able to assign permissions to virtual repositories for local and remote repositories. 

This way, we can allow users to interact with virtual repositories only, and local and remote can be in the background, managed by admins. 

The flow would be like:
 # Assign users/groups permissions to Virtual (read, annotate, deploy/cache, etc)
 # Assign the virtual repo permissions to affiliated remote/local (read, deploy/cache, etc)

This way, users will not see or interact in any fashion with remote nor local repositories, and only have to interact with the virtual repositories.

The reason for this schema is to ensure least amount of confusion when users interact with the ""set me up"" section. Currently there is no way to prevent the user from interacting with remote and local because if prevent via permissions, they will then be unable to interact with virtual as well. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact

There are more details on Gradle's site: [https://docs.gradle.com/build-cache-node/]

 

Essentially, gradle (open source and enterprise) has the ability to use a standalone JAR that when executed will listen on tcp port(s) to allow the gradle build agent to get and push a shared cache amongst many desperate build agents.  The performance increases are very well documented and reduce build time by at least half in most cases.  Having an enterprise license does unlock additional features - but just having the ability for this to be housed in artifactory would be amazing for us!

*Steps to reproduce:*

1. Run 2 Docker Centos images - 1 for the RPM server and  1 for the yum client

2. On the server:
- Create a folder and put an rpm package in it
- Run the following command to create the repomd repository:
{code}
createrepo . -u http://avivcentos
{code}
The -u flag specifies the base URL. More info here: https://linux.die.net/man/8/createrepo

3. Still on the server:
- Install Nginx and put the following in /etc/nginx/conf.d/repos.conf:
{code}
server {
        listen   80;
        server_name  avivcentos;	#change  test.lab to your real domain
        root   /root/aviv;
        location / {
                index  index.php index.html index.htm;
                autoindex on;	#enable listing of directory index
        }
}
{code}
- Reload Nginx, now your server is ready to be used

4. On Artifactory:
- Create an RPM remote repository and point it to http://avivcentos
- Use the set me up to configure the Centos client

5. On the client:
- After configuring the above, run yum update
- Run yum install for the package from step 2
- yum should install the requested package
However, while repodata/repomd.xml file *will be cached to Artifactory*, the *actual package will not*. The client bypassed Artifactory in order to download the package.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact

This is a request to have Artifactory reporting *package metadata* calculation statistics, metrics and performance info.

Some examples/ideas:

1. E.g. Debian Metadata, how many *metadata artifacts* (Release, Packages..) are being created *right now* for a certain repo
2. Last calculation time, result, new added metadata files
3. How many artifacts have yet to have metadata calculated for
4. Create a performance KPI for metadata artifacts calculation 

Users could potentially gain these insights:

1. See 'what work is being done by Artifactory' currently (for the packages metadata calculation context)
2. Understanding if the system could be capped (insufficient resource, threads allocated) 
3. Measure if and how a system tune up, be it hardware, JVM, or Artifactory system parameters affect the metadata calculation performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact

 * More than 10k fluctuating ldap groups.
 * Permissions are granted based on ldap groups.
 * Configuration of repositories and permissions have to be versionized.
 * Changes on repos have to be checked before they get rolled out to artifactory. Checks like:
 * Is the user that requested the changes in a ldap group that has permissions for a repo
 * Are changes valid? E.g. does the repo exist that is added to a virtual repository.

The usage of include patterns for replication tasks is not suitable in case the source repository has more than 200 ""trees"" and only two or three shall be excluded from replication.

 

Example:

Currently the only way to exclude some artifacts from being transferred into the target Artifactory repository when using push replication is setting exclude patterns on the target repository itself. The replication process indeed still tries to upload all artifacts to the target repository, even in case the target repository has an exclude pattern configured for a complete artifact tree (Maven artifact repository, excluding for example ""com/**/*"", ""org/**/*""). Due to trying to upload those artifacts, excessive bandwidth usage may be the result, causing hundreds of gigabytes of artifacts being transferred before finally being rejected by the receiving Artifactory instance.

 

Suggestion:

Either extend replication tasks to offer exclude patterns, or take the exclude patterns of the receiving Artifactory instance into account for replication (would require publishing/reading of exclude patterns to the source Artifactory server).

The majority of local repos and namespaces are still protected. Credentials hence authentication challenges are still needed to access the protected files. We have a lot of internally developed python code that expects the authentication challenging behavior. They now break. From our view, the same python code should get the same result when accessing the same protected files, regardless anonymous is enabled or not for other files. Credential based interactions should continue to operate the same way. 

Here is what I propose how to solve this problem: Jfrog can create a system property that enables/disables the credential challenging behavior for protected files after anonymous access is turned on. The default is not challenging (current state). The majority of your customers will not be impacted as a result. But we can change this setting to force a credential challenge for protected files.

The new init flow has the following advantages over the previous primary-role based HA topology:
 # The new init flow will allow the user to start multiple nodes at the same time (in no particular order), regardless to whether the cluster is being upgraded or not. Note that only one node can perform the most of the initialization flow at once. When the initialization flow is being performed from one node, others will wait for it to finish before continuing their own init.

*+Specification+*:

The new init flow inits the database schema as soon as possible, and then wraps the rest of the init flow inside an HA lock. The following two phases are wrapped inside a lock - 
 # Config - the first phase, where PRE_INIT, HOME and HOME_SYNC converters run, among other procedures such as the init of the master.key, the start of the config manager, etc.
 # App Context - the second phase, where all the ReloadableBean converters are called one by one, and POST_INIT converters are also called.

To allow all nodes in the cluster to be started in parallel, the new init flow will perform the following procedure:
 # Check whether an upgrade is due, and attempt to insert a lock on the init flow.
 # If a lock can be acquired, hold the lock while running the init, and release it when it ends.
 # If a lock cannot be acquired, wait for the lock to be removed, and continue where left off after the lock is released.

Regular expression support for selecting repository names in permissions,RTFACT-18679,69029,New Feature,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,lefebvre,lefebvre,05/Mar/19 5:13 PM,16/Jun/20 6:16 AM,18/Feb/21 8:48 AM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,dsl,mission-control,permissions,,,,,"Currently, with the permission Mission Control DSL block must be supplied with a list of repository names via the ""repositories"" option.   In cases where you have many defined repositories and have more custom rules as to when they are to be included, it's very useful to have the ability to regular expressions to match against the repo names. 

For example, say you have over a hundred repositories defined, and you have a specific permission named ""security"", for which you wanted it to include only the following list of repos:
 * yum-security-updates-local
 * yum-security-packages-local
 * yum-security-remote
 * docker-security-local

Currently, the resource would then have to be specified like this:
{code:java}
  permissions {
    permission('security') {
      includesPattern '**'
      excludesPattern ''
      anyLocal false
      anyRemote false
      anyDistribution false
      repositories ([""yum-security-updates-local"", ""yum-security-packages-local"", ""yum-security-remote"", ""docker-security-local""])
      groups {
        admins (['manage', 'delete', 'deploy', 'annotate', 'read']) 
      }
    }
  }
{code}
Although having the ability to specify repository name inclusions/exclusions regexes could help simplify this.  For example, something like this would be useful:
{code:java}
  permissions {
    permission('security') {
      includesPattern '**'
      excludesPattern ''
      anyLocal false
      anyRemote false
      anyDistribution false
      repositoriesIncludesPatterns (["".*-security-.*""])
      groups {
        admins (['manage', 'delete', 'deploy', 'annotate', 'read']) 
      }
    }
  }{code}
Or also to specify exclusions, calculated after the inclusions, something like this:
{code:java}
  permissions {
    permission('security') {
      includesPattern '**'
      excludesPattern ''
      anyLocal false
      anyRemote false
      anyDistribution false
      repositoriesIncludesPatterns (["".*-security-.*""])
      repositoriesIncludesPatterns (["".*-remote$""])
      groups {
        admins (['manage', 'delete', 'deploy', 'annotate', 'read']) 
      }
    }
  }{code}
This second example would then narrow down the inclusion to only the following repository names:
 * yum-security-updates-local
 * yum-security-packages-local
 * docker-security-local

Currently, implemented code in my MissionControl script to simulate this logic, although it would be much more convenient to have it built in to the resource.  Another option could be to modify the current *includesPattern*/*excludesPattern* to accept list of regular expressions which could also match on the repository name.

As a note, this ticket is similar to RTFACT-12515, which i also related to regular expressions although only for the existing *includesPattern*/*excludesPattern* that only affects the artifact path.

In the last meeting session with our team manager [~yonatanb], we've tried to bond our Artifactory instance and Edge node to promote release artifacts.
Unfortunately we've faced with firewall limitations.

So I wondered, would be great in such cases use service interface only provided by NGINX we already use.

The idea is to use rewriting requests to different ports of applications and hide it into logical locations as described there [https://gist.github.com/tzutalin/4412f50aea1ea864c24134647eca20f8]
and partly there [https://support.jfrog.com/jFrogKnowledgePage].
As we could know, nginx uses epoll event model(for Linux kernel), so replication could load one or more nginx worker process(-es), well it wouldn't take influence to performance of main app but hide listening ports and will give possibility to use REST(e.g.) API.
Also network layer for consumers will require opened one firewall port only.

As limitation I see maximum length of uploaded content client_max_body_size and upload_max_file_size settings used on server and location contexts. It could be set per location.

Our desired workflow is this: 
Every product team has 2 repositories for their product, dev and production. The developers will push their packages (via Jenkins or other) with proper build info to dev repository and then later on the packages can be promoted to production repository (when for example the package is ready for production). No one should be able to directly push their packages to the production repository, only via promotion from dev.

With current permission scheme we would need to give the deploy rights to production repository to allow the users to promote their packages from dev to production repo, but unfortunately this would also allow them to push artifacts directly to the production repository.

I think that this kind of promote permission would make a lot of sense and would be needed to achieve the kind of workflow that I described which I think would be very welcome especially in regulated enterprise environments.

Expose reverse proxy templates to users for modification,RTFACT-18389,67495,New Feature,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,robert.joseph.wright,robert.joseph.wright,29/Jan/19 4:50 PM,04/Feb/19 8:43 AM,18/Feb/21 8:48 AM,,,,,,,,,,,Reverse Proxy Configuration Generator,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,"Background:

I am using Artifactory in docker, along with the provided nginx reverse proxy. The automatic configuration of nginx by Artifactory is very convenient. However, it does not always work the way I want it to. In HA mode, for example, I do not want nginx to act as a load balancer, since I already use a load balancer in front of nginx. My solution was to override the /updateConf.sh script in the nginx docker image, to modify the config output returned by Artifactory before it is written to disk. Using sed :(.

 

Feature request:

Allow the user to specify an nginx (or other reverse proxy) config template (such as Mustache, Jinja, or similar), which will expand based on context variables passed in by Artifactory.

 

Examples:

The default template might look something like this:

 
{code:java}
{% if ha.enabled %}
## add HA entries when ha is configure
upstream artifactory {
   {% for server in ha.servers %}
   server {{ server.hostname}}:{{ server.port }};
   {% endfor %}
}
{% endif %}

{% for server in virtual_servers %}
## server configuration
server {

    listen {{ server.port }};
    
    server_name {{ server_name }};

    # ... More stuff here ...
}
{% endfor %}{code}
 

Now if the user wished to change the nginx configuration, they could modify and upload a new template, provided they use the variables that are provided by Artifactory.

 

In my case, I would have modified the above to look more like:
{code:java}
{% if ha.enabled %}
## add HA entries when ha is configure
upstream artifactory {
   server artifactory:{{ server.port }};
}
{% endif %}

{% for server in virtual_servers %}
## server configuration
server {

    listen {{ server.port }};
    
    server_name {{ server_name }};

    # ... More stuff here ...
}
{% endfor %}
{code}
This way the traffic would be forwarded only to the local linked artifactory container instead of all HA nodes.

** Enable ""Edit Profile"" for users so users are able to create API keys.
* (As SAML user): Login to Artifactory and provision an API key.

Follow-up on this. It's still actual and good to have.","22/Oct/19 9:17 AM;momcilo.majic@elektrobit.com;Dear development team,

In which version will this be addressed?

Please note that current default is subdomain for *_dockerReverseProxyMethod_*, which essentially requires the setup a new DNS record or use wildcards.

Our use case can involve multiple projects each having it's own docker, which kind of requires the 2 different teams to work together in IT (network + team responsible for artifactory). We have multiple artifactories in star/full mesh configuration and would naturally not want to update this setting manually.

If this can not be solved quickly, could you please set as a default in your next release?

I am using the Artifactory plugin 2.6 in TeamCity to deploy Maven artifacts to Artifactory Maven repositories. I have both release (libs-release) and snapshot (libs-snapshot) repositories set up for my project. For build and deploy, everything works fantastically, snapshots and releases are correctly deployed to the appropriate repositories defined in the fields ""Target repository"" and ""Target snapshot repository"".

The problem is with the retention section. If I choose ""Discard Old Builds:"" and use ""Max # Of Builds To Keep:"", the number entered is a collective total of builds in both release and snapshot repositories.


Example:
I have max # of builds to keep set at 3
Build run 1 release (successfully deploys to libs-release maven repo)
Build run 2 snapshot (successful to libs-snapshot repo)
Build run 3 snapshot (again)
Build run 4 snapshot (again, all successful)

At this point, the release artifacts (from run 1) are deleted, even though they are in a separate repository than the last run. Because we have way more snapshot builds than release builds, using the same Max # as a total of the 2 repositories does not make sense.

Either of these options would be a suitable solution for this issue: 
1) apply the current Max # rule value to each repository separately (max 3 in each repo for example)
2) give each repository its own Max # field (Max # of snapshots to keep & Max # of releases to keep)

it would be a nice feature if Artifactory was able to mirror/proxy Jenkins plugins.

In Jenkins plugin configuration you need to address the update-center.json ([https://updates.jenkins.io/update-center.json]) which contains all the dirct URLs for the Plugin

You need some software that creates the update-center.json for the Artifactory repository URL.

There are some Github projects already

As of now jenkins official plugins repo(updates.jenkins.io) is pulling most of the plugins from updates.jenkins-ci.org and few other remote locations.
So even if we try to mirror the jenkins plugins repo, it is just grabing the metadata information (from where to download) from it and downloading it from the remote locations and Here the requirement is something like Artifactory should be having some mechanism to cache and store all the plugins which are getting fetched irrespective of the remote location.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RTFACT-15927,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Product,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|hzy40v:",,,,,,,UNCOVERED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Artifactory,,,,,,,100.0,,,,,,,,,,,,"12/Dec/18 8:46 PM;bmerkle;i think this would be usefull for many jenkins and artifactory users.

i think they removed it because it was never usable.

You only proxy the plugin.xml (not sure if it is the right filename) but inside the plugin.xml are the plugins listed with WAN URLs.
You can't change the file or URLs because its checksum base security.

This happened a few times a day. After some investigation, we concluded this was caused by a project accessing a virtual maven repo which consists of several local repos and public remote repos such as jcenter.

 

*Project setup:*
 * User has a maven project with many public dependencies such as org.apache.activemq
 * User resolves these dependencies through an artifactory virtual repository.
 * Virtual repository consists of many local repositories, then remote repositories pointing to different places such as jcenter.
 * Local repositories do not allow the user to read the org folder. User can only access gov/nasa/jpl folder in the local repos.

 

*Current behavior:*

Since most of the dependencies are from remote repos (such as jcenter), when the user performs the maven build, Artifactory logs indicate many [DENIED DOWNLOAD] entries for each dependency for the artifact from local repositories, followed by an [ACCEPTED DOWNLOAD] entry for the artifact from the remote repository. Since there are so many dependencies, the process generates thousands of messages in the log for a very short period of time (such as 7,000 log messages in 2 minutes).

 

*Request improvement:*

Artifactory can just log which artifact is downloaded from which repo within the virtual repo and ignore all false-positive messages about [DENIED DOWNLOAD].

I have a support ticket at https://support.jfrog.com/jFrogCasePage?id=5001r00001pfvxS. I was told in that ticket to create a feature request.

In that ticket, the suggestion to backup AWS S3 backend data is to enable versioning of AWS S3. However, S3 versioning is for individual file rather than the whole bucket. Therefore, we will need to figure out the relationship of each file to its SHA in order to recover data to certain time point. It is not easy (if it is even possible) for this kind of development outside Artifactory code base. Basically there is no way to recover artifacts if there is a disaster in the current system.

This is a request for Artifactory to develop capability to record necessary information when S3 versioning is enabled in order to recover artifacts when there is a disaster. Also, a simple and easy to follow procedure for artifact recovery when S3 versioning is enabled should be documented.

Artifactory has become a popular tool for artifact sharing, storage, and retrieval. Artifact safety is important for enterprise usage and adoption. Thanks.

In regulated entities an IAM user with a static password is not compliant with application security guidelines (must use federated, temporary credentials that upon expiration do not require an Artifactory application restart) and we obviously operate on premises and not in AWS so an IAM role will not work either. 

This means that Artifactory does not currently provide enterprises operating on premise Artifactory infrastructure an operationally feasible authentication solution.

Artifactory is not allowing to connect to S3 bucket when using the FIPS endpoint URL,RTFACT-17396,61464,New Feature,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,3 - High,,,nihalc@jfrog.com,nihalc@jfrog.com,24/Aug/18 8:11 PM,23/Jun/19 3:23 PM,18/Feb/21 8:48 AM,,5.10.4,6.0.1,6.3.0,,,,,,,Filestore,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,"Artifactory is not allowing to connect to S3 bucket when using the FIPS endpoint URL. FIPS is a US government standard that specifies the security requirements for cryptographic modules that protect sensitive information. [https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fips/]

 

We need to support the FIPS endpoint URL as this is used by Government agencies who have to follow security requirements set by US government.

 

Steps to Reproduce:

1.Use a S3 bucket for your Artifactory instance

2.when specifying the endpoint URL in binarystore.xml please use FIPS url ""s3-fips.us-west-1.amazonaws.com"". The region in url will change depending on where your s3 bucket exists.

3.When starting Artifactory it will be successful, but you will see the below warning:

*4.If you try to specify the AWS signature version 4 in the binarystore.xml, then the startup of Artifactory fails when using FIPS endpoint url. Here is that parameter* 

*<s3AwsVersion>AWS4-HMAC-SHA256</s3AwsVersion>*

 

There are two issues here:

1.When using FIPS url without the signature version 4 although the Artifactory startup is successful you see the below warning which is not expected: 

2018-08-24 11:57:49,056 [art-init] [INFO ] (o.a.a.f.t.j.s.S3JetS3tBinaryProvider:464) - Connecting to S3 endpoint: 's3-fips.us-west-1.amazonaws.com'

*2. The more serious issue is the one where if you specify the AWS signature version 4 in binarystore.xml then the startup of Artifactory fails.*

 

*Workaround if you are using AWS signature version 4 in binarystore.xml is to remove the parameter from binarystore.xml that specifies the signature version:*

The Swift is a cross-platform language(MacOS, Ubuntu, Future Platform) so developers would need a cross-platform build system for Swift.

Since this is a cross-platform language, developers would also want to share their code, regardless the platform or where they are - and it has a standard to share libraries(its canonical).

The Swift package manager is an open source project.
Its a tool for managing distribution of source code, aimed at making it easy to share code and reuse others’ code. The tool compiling and linking Swift packages, managing dependencies, versioning, and supporting flexible distribution and collaboration models.

Link to the Github project: [https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager]

Link to the documentation can be found on [https://swift.org|https://swift.org/]

 

+How to use it?+

It consists with 4 basic operations

$ swift build - to build your package.

$ swift run - to run your package.

$ swift test - to run tests

$ swift package - to perform various none build operations on the package.

The packages are stored in Github and their versions are represented with Git tags.

Swift package consists of 3 main parts - Targets, Products and Dependencies(see attached swift manifest example).

Nonetheless, Artifactory appears to be *ignoring* the URL provided by VSTS in the {{<content .../>}} element of the atom/xml feed and instead constructing it's own download URL based on an assumption that all nuget feeds follow the default nuget repo layout used by nuget.org.

From a support ticket today:
{quote}
Currently, there is no repository setting change that would make Artifactory form a download URL that VSTS can accept, because Artifactory constructs a download URL similar to what nuget.org supports. For example, the download URL for nuget.org is ""GET /api/v2/package/Microsoft.AspNetCore/1.1.0-preview1-final"", where the download context path is api/v2/package, and the <package>/<version> is appended after the download context path. 

However, there is no download path for VSTS, while the format that is expected is ?id=<package>&version=<version>, which Artifactory currently doesn't support.
{quote}

In other words, despite being able to succesfully read a metadata feed from a VSTS nuget feed, Artifactory *ignores* the metadata in that feed and *assumes that the download path follows nuget.org conventions*.

Our growth in our npm repository in particular has been astronomical. Unfortunately, this means that it is increasingly hard to find packages. Artifactory's built in search only seems to cover package names and versions.

 

We are hoping for some more features like npmjs.org, crates.io, or pypi.org where search looks at the package descriptions, arbitrary user tags, and other metadata that comes from the package itself. The home pages for a package on those registries with integrated READMEs, project info, etc. are icing on the cake that make it much easier to find packages.

 

We are also in the process of deploying the xray product which gives us more search flexibility, but the metadata it searches does not seem end-user friendly and seems geared towards compliance tools.

 

We're aware of searching through fields like `npm.description`. However, we'd still like to request that the usability of these features be improved. For our end-users its difficult for them to know how to go the the property search page, and which properties to use. When I use npmjs.com or pypi.org when I do a package search its unified over all of the package metadata.

 

Secondly, the way the results are displayed is not friendly to package consumers. If I search for a package it returns every version matching the description. It doesn't show the published package name, but rather the file e.g. my-package-0.2.0.tgz. There is no description of the package displayed on this page, you need to click the ""show in tree"" button which is not too intuitive unless you're an admin, then you need to click over the to the ""npm info"" tab. In contrast if I search on npm, I'm greeted with these friendly results (see attached) with easy access to the relevant details of the package for a consumer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|hzxi5z:",,,,,,,UNCOVERED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Artifactory,,,,,,,100.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use built-in Artifactory accounts and have a strict security configuration with password expiration policy. We also have a *Services* group in Artifactory which contains all user accounts for our various services which connect to Artifactory, like Bamboo agents (svc_bamboo user), Terraform automation (svc_terraform user) etc. The mailboxes of these services are not generally monitored, so when the passwords of these services expire and a notification email is sent to their relative mailboxes, we normally don't know about it and then we need to manually unexpire the accounts when we realize something has stopped working (e.g. Bamboo can't connect to Artifactory).

It would be great, if we can automatically rotate passwords, but it isn't practical to do this e.g. in Bamboo so we have decided to stick with unexpiring password for some of our services.

Three values are currently auto-populated into this editable *exclude patterns* field (*password*,*key*,*secret*).  But we want these patterns to be fixed and not editable because users can remove them and obtain passwords or secrets for shared build accounts.

1. The plugin should enforce a fixed/built-in set of *non-editable* exclude patterns (*password*,*key*,*secret*)*. T*hese fixed patterns should be case insensitive.

2. The plugin can continue to offer (as it does today) an editable set of exclude patterns that would be appended to the fixed/built-in set.

Allow file spec / AQL to download from virtuals,RTFACT-16981,58984,New Feature,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,patrickr,patrickr,19/Jun/18 3:50 PM,19/Jun/18 3:59 PM,18/Feb/21 8:48 AM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,"Symptoms: When attempting to pull files from a virtual repository, the Jenkins Artifactory plugin will instead pull directly from the local repository where it found the file. This can interfere with JAR Signing and other virtual repository functions.

The Jenkins Artifactory Plugin's file spec system relies on the Artifactory Query language, which currently does not support virtual repository download URLs.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Use a download spec that contains the path of the virtual repository as a part of the *pipeline build:spec= """"""{*

              *""files"": [*

 *server.download spec: downloadSpec*

2. Run the build

3. Observe in the request logs that the CI Server requests the local file, rather than the virtual file:

we managed to solve this issue by by migrating to composer v2 (composer self-update --2). With composer 1 we experienced the same issue.

I am requesting that JFrog implement a third option (which is sort of a hybrid of the two current approached).  The feature would work like this: 1) baseline backup performed on day one; 2) incremental backups taken every day thereafter; 3) when the number of daily incremental backups taken equals the number specified as the 'retention period', a new baseline backup is taken and the cycle repeats.

I would like to export the configuration of a running Artifactory instance to YAML.
Right now it's only possible to export the configs to XML with the configuration and security descriptor menu options.

The reason is just, that I want to switch to YAML configuration files only, because they are a lot easier to handle with my configuration management system and easier to read.
But it's way to cumbersome to rewrite the whole configuration from scratch, test it and so on.
A simple export option would make this much easier.

{code:java}
The version attribute value may either be a single explicit version or a version constraint expression. Constraint expressions use the following syntax to specify a range of versions that are acceptable:

>= 1.2.0: version 1.2.0 or newer
<= 1.2.0: version 1.2.0 or older
~> 1.2.0: any non-beta version >= 1.2.0 and < 1.3.0, e.g. 1.2.X
~> 1.2: any non-beta version >= 1.2.0 and < 2.0.0, e.g. 1.X.Y
>= 1.0.0, <= 2.0.0: any version between 1.0.0 and 2.0.0 inclusive

When depending on third-party modules, references to specific versions are recommended since this ensures that updates only happen when convenient to you.

For modules maintained within your organization, a version range strategy may be appropriate if a semantic versioning methodology is used consistently or if there is a well-defined release process that avoids unwanted updates.

Version constraints are supported only for modules installed from a module registry, such as the Terraform Registry orTerraform Cloud's private module registry. Other module sources can provide their own versioning mechanisms within the source string itself, or might not support versions at all. In particular, modules sourced from local file paths do not support version; since they're loaded from the same source repository, they always share the same version as their caller.

Packages are traditionally composed of partial filesystem trees with metadata and scripts attached, and these are dynamically assembled on the client machine, after a process of dependency resolution.

In contrast, OSTree only supports recording and deploying complete (bootable) filesystem trees. It has no built-in knowledge of how a given filesystem tree was generated or the origin of individual files, or dependencies, descriptions of individual components. Put another way, OSTree only handles delivery and deployment; you will likely still want to include inside each tree metadata about the individual components that went into the tree.

Please add ostree support (including things like automatic caching.)

As a platform administrator of the Artifactory Platform at Eli Lilly, I wold like to be able to use Artifactory as an Oauth Provider, so I can perform actions on behalf of a user and their access level, I cam able to get specific information about who that user is and their access levels in Artifactory.

*Further Information*
Here at Lilly, we use Service Now as the catalog tool, where people have requests for GitHub Repositories, Heroku applications, and Contentful spaces. Think of Service Now as the front door for creating things here at Lilly. One key item for this to work successfully, is we need to know who that user is in Artifactory, and what permissions they have to certain repositories, and groups etc. The way that we do this is normally via Oauth. We have an option called ""Login with Artifactory"" which will ask the user to authenticate with Artifactory, the Artifactory will return some sort of token to Service Now which can be used to interact with the Artifactory API on behalf of that user. We can drive a real personalized experience for our end customers if we do this. 

Currently, Service Now does not support the ability to be able to act as an Oauth provider. We would see large value in this being a feature, especially for enterprise customers. We are currently on the latest version of Artifactory (SaaS) (Enterprise)

Subject: Re: [#xxxxxx] how to direct artifactory backup to Azure blob storage

Hi Sharene,

Thank you for contacting us.

When working with Artifactory HA, the primary member is responsible to collect and perform the backups and save them at the location you have configured to it.

Currently there is no out of the box configuration which point Artifactory to save the backup directly to S3/Azure/Google storage, you can upload the backups manually or to create a script which will upload the backup automatically.

You are welcome to open feature request for this feature in our public JIRA system and we will contact our Product Manager regard it, if you will open feature request, kindly elaborate about the use case.

Improve RubyGem metadata efficency,RTFACT-15652,52100,New Feature,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,patrickr,patrickr,15/Jan/18 2:58 PM,18/Nov/18 8:36 PM,18/Feb/21 8:48 AM,,,,,,,,,,,Metadata,RubyGems,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,"Current Situation:

Currently the RubyGem Spec file generated by Artifactory contains duplicate strings, making the file very large compared to a similar file generated by [https://rubygems.org/|https://rubygems.org/].

This difference is not detectable during operations on a small to medium Artifactory Gems repository, however as the number of Gem files increase the larger the spec file becomes. 

Steps to reproduce:
At around 180,000 artifacts, the Gem client needs far more time to process the Artifactory Gem Spec file compared to the one it pulls from rubygems.org. This can be observed by checking the sizes of the two spec files:

*du .gem/specs/
40488    .gem/specs/[ART_URL]%8081/artifactory/api/gems/gems-virtual
[...]
15712    .gem/specs/api.rubygems.org%443*

Current workarounds are to have smaller RubyGem repositories to limit the metadata size. 

A potential solution to this problem would be to generate a gemspec metadata file that contains pointers to shared strings; this is what rubygems.org does to keep its metadata file small.

Our users would also be glad to have a working remote and cache for the Drupal packages.


It seems that Artifactory provide a non configurable _providers-lazy-url_ in the packages url : [https://example.com/artifactory/api/composer/drupal-composer-remote/packages.json|https://host/artifactory/api/composer/drupal-composer-remote/packages.json]

_providers-lazy-url_ : [https://|https://host/artifactory/api/composer/drupal-composer-remote/p/%package%.json] [example.com|https://host/artifactory/api/composer/drupal-composer-remote/packages.json] [/artifactory/api/composer/drupal-composer-remote/p/%package%.json|https://host/artifactory/api/composer/drupal-composer-remote/p/%package%.json]

Even if this pattern works for packagist, ie : [https://packagist.org/p/drupal/core.json]

It does not for the [https://packages.drupal.org/8] source even if querying package by SHA256 works, as an example for _drupal/admin_toolbar_ :
 * [https://packages.drupal.org/8/packages.json]
 * [https://packages.drupal.org/8/p/drupal/admin_toolbar.json|https://packages.drupal.org/8/packages.json] (404)
 * [https://packages.drupal.org/8/drupal/provider-2019-3$99fbe12d50f95301b37d811679313f143eafb3deecc8f63c4079dd808f4a3562.json]

Also, as far as Artifactory remote composer repository configuration is concerned, we have tried :
 * to set the source URL for binary host (*URL*, I believe this should be set as [https://ftp.drupal.org|https://ftp.drupal.org/] in this case)
 * to select a *custom* git provider
 ** There is a *Download* *URL* available, but there is no documentation on it, should this be [https://git.drupalcode.org|https://git.drupalcode.org/] ? Check also https://www.jfrog.com/jira/browse/RTFACT-14354
 ** The Registry URL set to [https://packages.drupal.org/8/]

Nevertheless, this did not work.

the problem seems to be on the drupal repository side, Rene could you have a look ?","28/May/20 9:36 AM;jrenaudo;Hi,

After some thorough investigation, it looks like JFrog entirely ignore the `packages.json` file that it's supposed to use to get the correct paths for the providers/packages.

When I address a specific package on JFrog (example: /p/drupal/ctools.json), JFrog immediately tries to target /p/drupal/ctools.json on the repository it proxies, without trying to read packages.json.

I'm under the impression that /p/%packages%.json is hard-coded when trying to get informations for a remote repository, ignoring packages.json.

Can someone confirm that it currently works like this?","13/Nov/20 12:53 PM;jrenaudo;Hi,

Is there any news about this issue or any plan to support Drupal 8 repositories at all?

We recently updated to the last version of JFrog and I was hoping this issue was fixed, unfortunately it's not.

@O'briat the issue is probably not on Drupal 8 side otherwise `composer` would not work at all, and all my investigations has led to the fact that JFrog seems only to support packagist-like composer repositories, making some assumptions on the packages URLs, ignoring the packages.json definition file.

The issue is that Artifactory limits us to using 4 files under the repodata folder, which we cannot modify the files or add more files to the folder.

*The feature we want is to add and modify XML files under the repodata folder.*

Currently, this is what Artifactory's repodata folder looks like:

repomd.xml

other.xml.gz
filelist.xml.gz

However, our team uses SUSE's metadata files and wants the repodata folder to look like this:
{code}
repomd.xml --- need to edit this file 
primary.xml.gz
other.xml.gz
filelist.xml.gz
updateinfo.xml  --- we need this file to be added in the repodata folder
deltainfo.xml --- we need this file to be added in the repodata folder
{code}

We have tried adding the updateinfo.xml file and modifying the repomd.xml file in Artifactory ourselves, but the repodata folder gets refreshed and our changes get erased.

We create idempotent Ansible roles to install our Artifactory, so we run this role to install a server, but also to add new nodes in a HA setup where we run the role a second time against all hosts in the cluster. If you can configure the initial password in artifactory.config.import.yml, you're sure that there is no doubt about the password. Once Artifactory is started, the password is set to the configured value.

Using the API to change the password from the default ""password"" to something custom at the initial installation is possible, but it will complicate things. You need a check to find out if this is an initial install and test somewhere if the password has been changed before. It's not really elegant to call the api and check for a 403 and it might even block the admin account if something goes wrong.","10/Dec/19 5:15 PM;prathameshd9;Would definitely like this setting.

Have a look at this Artifactory plugin:
https://github.com/clolin/artifactory-user-plugins/blob/master/governance/preventXrayRejected/preventXrayRejected.groovy

Can we get a plugin like this to modify the HTTP Response Reason Phrase?

The use case is that we want to pass a message from our plugin to Maven users.

If you try to build using Maven, the message set in this example will never reach the user, like this:
""
[ERROR] Plugin org.codehaus.mojo:license-maven-plugin:1.8 or one of its dependencies could not be resolved: Could not transfer artifact org.codehaus.mojo:license-maven-plugin:jar:1.8 from/to central (http://gew1-artifactory4gcp-a-pkj5:8081/artifactory/libs-release): Access denied to: http://gew1-artifactory4gcp-a-pkj5:8081/artifactory/libs-release/org/codehaus/mojo/license-maven-plugin/1.8/license-maven-plugin-1.8.jar , ReasonPhrase:Forbidden. -> [Help 1]
""

But the HTTP Reason Phrase would (""ReasonPhrase:Forbidden"" in the above example), that's why we want to be able to modify it.

Note that as long as the Reason Phrase doesn't contain any newlines, it is fine to put anything in there:
https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec6.html#sec6.1.1

Thank you for reaching us.

With regards to the scenario you are presenting, we would like to clarify and suggest a solution. 
When we perform a promotion we do it for a whole build and not just for a single artifact. Artifactory will know from the build info (name and number) what artifacts need to be promoted. 

In the scenario you present, you say the build is no longer in Jenkins, and this is why you cannot perform the promotion from Jenkins. 
As a workaround, if the build info still exists in Artifactory, although it is not in Jenkins, you can use [""Working With Pipeline Jobs in Jenkins""|https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Working+With+Pipeline+Jobs+in+Jenkins#WorkingWithPipelineJobsinJenkins-PromotingBuildsinArtifactory]. You will just need to change the buildName and buildNumber accordingly and the artifacts associated with this buildInfo will be promoted. 

We hope this clarifies more.

We would like to clarify that before the plugin deploys the build info it deploys the build artifacts.
In case one of the build artifacts did not go through, which means we received a response different than 200, then the whole build would fail.

For repositories with a large number of small files this will mean that despite having a large amount of network bandwidth available, the replication speed is capped by this single thread. This is the case even for event based replication, as artifacts that are uploaded are added to the replication queue to be pushed one at a time.

This makes it impossible to retrieve old versions of a package through apt-get.

E.g.
I consume package A=1.0.0
The upstream mirror is updated to A=1.0.1
My mirror updates Packages.gz to reflect the upstream
I can no longer apt-get install A=1.0.0 from artifactory (though it exists on the server).

Prior to using Artifactory, we used a vanilla Nginx server as a yum repo and generic file store.  We enabled ""latest"" links by using regular filesystem sym links in our Nginx configuration.

Every time a new version of our yum artifacts was deployed, a new directory would be created and the latest symlink would be updated to point to it.  In other words, you could access the newest artifact path via http://our.yum.server/product_name/version_num/ or http://our.yum.server/product_name/latest/

This worked well in our yum .repo files, a simple ""yum install product_name"" was all it took to install a new version whenever it became available - this worked particularly well in our CI/CD pipelines.

However, there's no easy way to do this in Artifactory, I was able to replicate the functionality via a User Plugin which leveraged the beforeDownloadRequest execution point.  However, I ran into problems with that hook with virtual repositories and ended up writing a custom handler for the afterDownloadError execution point.  See my StackOverflow post here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40661376/artifactory-symlink-or-aliasing-an-artifact-url

Please note that in both cases, I was able to implement the download functionality I needed but my ""latest"" links are not visible in the web or native UIs.

For remote repositories, you can use the *Unused Artifacts Cleanup Period (Hr)* field. From Artifactory User Guide:
*Unused Artifacts Cleanup Period* - Many cached artifacts in Artifactory remote repository storage are actually unused by any current projects in the organization. This parameter specifies how long an unused artifact will be stored before it is removed. Once reaching this period Artifacts will be removed in the next invocation of cleanup. For more details please refer Cleanup Unused Cached Artifacts in Regular Maintenance Operations.
Leaving the field empty (default) means that the artifact is stored indefinitely.

Other than that, you can use Artifactory User Plugins to achieve the deletion of artifacts based on their creation / modification date. 
You can read more about User Plugins [here|https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/User+Plugins]. 

Hope that helps. ","27/Aug/19 6:54 AM;mb;+1 for this feature for local repositories.

Our biggest pain with Artifactory has been deleting old artifacts. This should be something that is included out of the box rather than relying on plugins. Especially as finding and installing third party plugins is not as straight forward as Jenkins or Atlassian products.

A field on local repositories where an expiry time can be entered would be extremely useful. In reality we only need to keep snapshots for a month and releases for maybe 6 months to a year. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

my goal is to navigate via REST through the +complete+ IVY-Repository (virtual) and find all ivy-{version}.xml files. 

*+1. enhancement (""Folder Info"" and ""File Info"")+* I noticed that is not possible with ""Folder Info"" and ""File Info"", because they only support local, local-cached and virtual repositories. Even inside the virtual repository only the entries from ""local"" or ""local-cached"" repositories will be included at result (JSON).

My favorite approach will be to include also the not cached information from remote repository. Maybe you can add a additional optional query parameter to include also content information of (not cached) remote repositories (because this request will take a little longer). And I think it would be useful to add a flag that shows if it is a local/ cached artifact or not. For example:

""children"": [
{
            ""uri"" : ""/child1"",
            ""folder"" : ""true""
_            ""local"" : ""false""_
        },{

*+2. bug - File List)+* My second approach is to use the ""File List"" REST-Interface, the documentation told me: +""2.5.2. Supported by all types of repositories.""+. In my opinion this means even the _not_cached_ remote artifacts should be listet into the result of this request. But also at this result only the local and local-cached repositories will be included. In my opinion this is a bug.

*+3. solution - own implementation)+* I prefer to to use a REST-Interface that is already present and only my last resort is to implement a plugin to solve this requirement.

I hope someone can help me very soon.

This feature request would provide a way to mirror & cache crates.io whilst allowing for local publish of company specific packages.

The crates.io repository is [here|https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io] and specifically includes this warning:
""DISCLAIMER: The process of setting up a mirror is a work-in-progress and is likely to change. It is not currently recommended for mission-critical production use. It also requires a version of cargo newer than 0.13.0-nightly (f09ef68 2016-08-02); the version of cargo currently on rustc's beta channel fulfils this requirement and will be shipped with rustc 1.12.0 scheduled to be released on 2016-09-29.""

so some work would probably be required to achieve this.

If you do decide to proceed with it then it's likely that you can get significant support from the rust community if you're willing to push changes back upstream to the crates.io project.

In either case the issue is difficult to track down and administrators are only made aware after working with support. 

Improvement:
Have a health check process that will attempt to use each remote repo in a way that verifies their health. Per-repo this can be incorporated into the ""Test"" button. Per Artifactory instance this could either be a background check that displays the status in the admin alert bar or a manual check done from the maintenance page.

When I add value 1 to the fileld ""Max Unique Tags"" in docker repository preferences a auto clean process will delete all tag except the newest ""abc:1.1-SNAPSHOT"".

It is possible to add a feature that user can define which docker tag is exluded from the cleaning? For example I want to define ""latest"" and ""cache-latest"" tag as a unremovable for the cleaning process.

Another thing. When I have in my repository a few images and some images was tagged SNAPSHOT I need to clean only tags with SNAPSHOT in name.

Support the new Gradle resolution convention,RTFACT-12701,37214,New Feature,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,alexeiv,alexeiv,20/Oct/16 2:13 PM,26/Dec/19 10:20 AM,18/Feb/21 8:48 AM,,4.13.0,4.13.2,,,,,,,,Gradle,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,"Gradle introduced with version 3.x a new resolution spec: Not using the buildScript but instead using the pluginRepositories in the settings.gradle. For example:

{code}
pluginRepositories {
   maven {
      url 'http://localhost:9090/artifactory/gradle-maven'
    }
  //  gradlePluginPortal()
}

{code}
Here you can find more information regarding the new spec:  https://docs.gradle.org/3.1/userguide/plugins.html#sec:subprojects_plugins_dsl

This convention find the artifacts with id. The request that Artifactory tried to resolve is using the following path in the URL:

/com.jfrog.artifactory.gradle.plugin/4.4.7/com.jfrog.artifactory.gradle.plugin-4.4.7.pom

This is the ID and not the actual resolution of the artifact. 
For example, resolving Artifactory plugin for Gradle, uses the following URL:

http://jcenter.bintray.com/com/jfrog/artifactory/com.jfrog.artifactory.gradle.plugin/4.4.7/com.jfrog.artifactory.gradle.plugin-4.4.7.pom

instead of downloading the build info and its dependencies as it was when using the buildScript:

{code}
  buildscript {
  repositories {
    //jcenter()
    
        maven {
      url 'http://localhost:9090/artifactory/gradle-remote'
    }
  }
    dependencies {
    classpath 'org.jfrog.buildinfo:build-info-extractor-gradle:4.4.7'

  }

}
{code}

This seems to occur since in the new convention there is only the id: 

id 'com.jfrog.artifactory' version '4.4.7'

When you use the official Gradle download site: 

{code}
pluginRepositories {
    gradlePluginPortal()
}
{code}

This works and the artifacts are being downloaded:

We are single-tenant shop, with customers on different versions, so there needs to be change-config code that matches the correct code base.  Having a local repository would grant us the ability to version our roles in a privately Galaxy repo, which corresponds to version of the code. This would be tremendous value-add for our organization, and almost certainly allows us standardize on Artifactory as the defacto solution for repos.

Also, we heavily use containers (docker) with immutable production patterns.  Ansible is very popular light-weight deploy and change-config tool for these solutions.  Unlike chef/puppet that are heavy weights for runtime change config, in the immutable production world, you don't need heavy robust change config, and so Ansible is incredibly popular in docker crowds for this reason.  We use it for deploy time change-config, e.g. templated environment variables or watch/wrapper scripts, and also for orchestration of containers and AWS cloud resources.","02/Mar/17 6:22 AM;alexlaverty;Hi Support,

Background 

While the initial focus of what we are doing is to establish an on-premise Artifactory repository for Open Source, we want the same group maintaining this new service to extend the capabilities to allow teams to their binary application deployment artifacts.   Having to maintain multiple Artifactory  installations (On Premise, AWS, Azure)  is not ideal in any scenario. 

While I don’t know the specifics of Artifactory, I wanted to describe how I could see this happening.   As part of the sharding setup for a given subdirectory, there would be an option for  specifying which Cloud Service (AWS, Azure, etc) is providing the storage – and requiring some type of  Artifactory “agent” running on that Cloud instance.  

The role of that agent would be to handle both reads/writes to that subdirectory –

1.	 Allowing teams to “Read”/access files the subdirectory without having to be downloaded

2.	Abstracting the write process – where the file gets written to the Cloud Storage WITHOUT having to be “downloaded” in any format.   Yes, there would be some information sent down specific to Metadata, but that would be acceptable

NOTE:  In a sense this could be considered  a Federated model.  But the goal is to maximize the usage of the service we are standing up, so we avoid having to install full Artifactory installations in other locations

However, I tested this with version 7.3.2 of Artifactory and DNF 4.2.7.

DNF utilizes three methods of adding repositories:
 # Adding a <repo>.repo to /etc/yum.repos.d/ per YUM standards.
 # Modifying the /etc/dnf/dnf.conf to add additional repos, following the same convention as a .repo file.
 # Running dnf config-manager --add-repo <repo-url>

I've tested with all three methods. My steps for each method will be below.

Before you begin:
 Artifactory with ""Quick Setup"" RPM repository.

*yum.repos.d:*

Move the files in /etc/yum.repos.d/ to another folder or rename to not end in .repo (mv *.repo ../old_repos/)

Create an artifactory.repo with the following text:
{code:java}
[Artifactory.repo]
name=Artifactory
baseurl=http://admin:password@artifactory:8081/artifactory/rpm/8/BaseOS/x86_64/os
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0{code}
dnf install tree

Note: Repository in the dnf install will show Artifactory.repo and after installing, the package will exist in rpm-remote-cache.

*dnf.conf:*

Move the files in /etc/yum.repos.d/ to another folder or rename to not end in .repo (mv *.repo ../old_repos/)

Add the following text to your dnf.conf:
{code:java}
[Artifactory.conf]
name=Artifactory
baseurl=http://admin:password@artifactory:8081/artifactory/rpm/8/BaseOS/x86_64/os
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
{code}
dnf install zip

Note: Repository in the dnf install will show Artifactory.conf and after installing, the package will exist in rpm-remote-cache.

*config-manager:*

Move the files in /etc/yum.repos.d/ to another folder or rename to note end in .repo (mv *.repo ../old_repos/)

dnf config-manager --add-repo [http://admin:password@artifactory:8081/artifactory/rpm/8/BaseOS/x86_64/os]

dnf install nano

Note: Repository in the dnf install will show the above URL and after installing, the package will exist in rpm-remote-cache.

When pulling images from a registry, you can ""pull by digest"", or use the digest instead of a tag. For example, the current version of the {{alpine:latest}} image on Docker Hub has digest:
{noformat}
sha256:3dcdb92d7432d56604d4545cbd324b14e647b313626d99b889d0626de158f73a
{noformat}
I can use this in a {{docker pull}} command, like so:
{noformat}
docker pull alpine@sha256:3dcdb92d7432d56604d4545cbd324b14e647b313626d99b889d0626de158f73a
{noformat}
Doing this ensures that I get the exact same version of the image. This is true because, if a new version of the image-tag pair is pushed to the Docker Hub, the old version hangs around and remains accessible via pull-by-digest.

This all works on Artifactory. However, when I push a new version of an image into Artifactory, the old manifest file and any layers that aren't used by the new image are placed into the trash. Pulling by digest for the old version of the image works, but only until the trash is cleared.

It would be nice if a new push for an existing image-tag pair tapped into Artifactory's support for versioning and made the pushed image act as a new version of the Docker image. Then we could prune old images properly and, ideally, select in the repository settings how many versions of a given tag we want to keep.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|hzrubr:",,,,,,,UNCOVERED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"06/Sep/16 10:06 PM;jpederzolli; RTFACT-9945 doesn't look to resolve this issue.

That is to say that as things stand right now, artifactory intentionally does not preserve layers that are not part of a defined tag.  So if you only ever pushed a layer to 'latest' and then you overwrite the 'latest' tag, the previous layers that are now no longer part of a defined tag are marked for cleanup.   Generally this is very much a desired behavior, although I can understand some use cases where it might not be.  In general our recommended behavior is that you push to a defined-version (or build number or whatever) tag, and then use the promote API to copy that tag to latest, rather than pushing directly to latest, so you have a defined human-readable tag to retrieve an earlier version.","07/Sep/16 9:01 PM;elyscape;I understand that, but my point is that it would be very useful to be able to access a certain number of old versions of a tag, like with Maven snapshots. This is something that is done by the Docker Hub and Docker's Registry, as well as [Quay|https://docs.quay.io/guides/tag-operations.html#viewing-tag-history-and-going-back-in-time] (both hosted and enterprise) and basically every other Docker registry project out there. The whole point of Docker image digests is that they're immutable and generally accessible even once the tag has moved on, with different projects offering different ways to clean up old images once they become unused.","21/Apr/17 8:46 PM;elyscape;This is actually worse now. Uploading a Docker image with the same name and tag will send the old layers into the trash and overwrite the manifest entirely, making it impossible to retrieve even the most recent old image.","02/Aug/18 7:42 PM;dhopkins;This is still an issue for me and my company. It would be great if the option to not trash old layers was exposed to operators. Instead, we'll have to write our own stuff to get around this issue by re-tagging every image with the sha256 just to keep it around. It's not going to be pretty. Developers would love to just use the traditional Docker and Dockerfile syntax like they do with every other registry out there (docker pull pkg_name@sha256:abcd... & FROM name@sha256:abcd...).","10/Aug/18 3:16 PM;cdenneen;Most registries give you the ability to cleanup untagged images older than X days.

This feature will be useful for Enterprises that have the anonymous access enabled at the global level by default but would like to disable it only for a few repositories.

Please review this option to automate importing of LDAP groups using REST api using the [create group|https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-CreateorReplaceGroup] request ([here|https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Security+Configuration+JSON#SecurityConfigurationJSON-application/vnd.org.jfrog.artifactory.security.Group+json] is an example of the payload).
When creating a new group use the *realm* field to indicate that the newly created group is an LDAP group and the *realmAttribute* field to set the relevant attributes.
{noformat}
PUT /api/security/groups/{groupName}
{
  - ""name"": ""dev-leads"",
  - ""description"" : ""The development leads group"",
  - ""autoJoin"" : false (default),
  - ""realm"": ""Realm name (e.g. ARTIFACTORY, CROWD)"",
  - ""realmAttributes"": ""Realm attributes for use by LDAP""
}
{noformat}

Here is an example of how this request will look like
{noformat}
PUT /api/security/groups/my-ldap-group
{
name: ""testGroup"",
description: ""some desc"",
autoJoin: false,
realm: ""ldap"",
realmAttributes: ""ldapGroupName=testgroup;groupsStrategy=STATIC;groupDn=cn=users,ou=jfrog,dc=org""
}
{noformat}

*NOTE* the group name *MUST* be in lowercase regardless of how it is configured in your LDAP server. 
","29/Aug/16 6:38 AM;Maras;@royz Roy - The real problem is the identification of appropriate attributes for  *realmAttribute* field. In an environment of a large corporation , these parameters are not fixed for each group. Therefore, for each group you want to create , you need to ask before the LDAP server for its attributes and then create such a group in the Artifactory. It is much more complicated than issuing Rest command ""import group called xxx from LDAP ""","16/Dec/18 1:58 PM;ehoggeg;[~royz]'s solution worked for me","16/Dec/18 3:02 PM;ehoggeg;actually, the group name was sufficient once I had the LDAP settings in place.

The permission target in question is one for a Release repository, where in the specific case we want to remove ‘Delete’ permissions from all but the system administrator user; but the more general case, of AND-ing a management group’s permissions with any permissions modified by the management group, would allow us to be even more fine-grained in the future if needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RTFACT-12049,RTFACT-7253,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|hzrvnr:",,,,,,,UNCOVERED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are using Artifactory as a replace of our Nexus service. However it seems there does not appear to be Nexus' equivalent of returning the latest version of a snapshot.","15/Jan/19 12:51 PM;awoodhead;Here is some more detail on the issue. When using Nexus we could fetch the latest SNAPSHOT version of an artifact (in the below example an RPM) with a single URL like this:

[https://nexushost/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=repo-name&g=my.group.idp&a=my-artifact&v=LATEST&e=rpm]

This allows us to have a one liner with curl which effectively does ""download the latest SNAPSHOT of my artifact"". As described above Artifactory doesn't seem to provide anything like this for SNAPSHOTS which means we have to go through a multi-step process in order to download the latest SNAPSHOT. There are various different ways of doing this but we have ended up with the following:

 
{code:java}
BASE_ARTIFACTORY_URL=https://artyhost/
ARTIFACTORY_REPOSITORY=my-maven-snapshot-local
# first get _all_ files for this artifact from the SNAPSHOT repo
RESULT=$(curl $BASE_ARTIFACTORY_URL/api/search/pattern?pattern=$ARTIFACTORY_REPOSITORY:my/group/id/my-artifact/*/*.rpm)
# now sort the results to ensure we get the latest one
LATEST_FILE=$(echo $RESULT |  jq -r '.files | sort [-1]')
#now finally we can build up the download URL to pass to curl
DOWNLOAD_URL=$BASE_ARTIFACTORY_URL$ARTIFACTORY_REPOSITORY/$LATEST_FILE


{code}
This feels error prone and far from ideal, it would be great if Artifactory could perform the above logic for us so we could get a direct download URL to the latest SNAPSHOT the same way you can for the latest RELEASE.","01/Apr/19 4:16 PM;payoon;Any update on this feature request?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have some builds that allow users to type/choose a version, and inclusive GAV information. If that artifact already exists we want that to fail the action of storing that artifact. To circumvent that, one would have remove the artifact from AP or allow temporary ability to redeploy artifacts.

I would imagine a simple check box on a local repository's 'Basic' setting just below the 'Suppress POM Consistency Checks' a similar looking 'Prohibit redeployment of same artifacts'.

For example, if the author of a gem indicated an MIT license without actually supplying the text, I don't know which version of MIT to use, or what the copyright line should be for that license (for example, is it ""(c) 2016 Jane Doe"" or is it ""(c) 2012-2014 John Smith""?)

This can't be done programmatically...it's not sufficient to search inside an artifact for a LICENSE file, since some artifacts don't have a LICENSE file, or have multiple files (for example, both LICENSE.MIT and LICENSE.LGPL).  Sometimes, the license text is embedded in another file (like COPYING or COPYRIGHT or README), or the license text is indicated by a URL to a website that requires navigation (or that may have moved from sourceforge to github, requiring human effort to track down its new home), or the author has neglected to indicate a license, requiring effort to contact them.

Since (non-trivial) human effort is involved in tracking down the license text for each open-source third-party dependency, once we've expended that effort, we'd like guidance as to the best place to store that information in Artifactory so we can later extract that text programmatically when building our TPLP.

   * verify if artifact's properties have been updated in the source server (introduction of a property checksum might help here as well)
   * if either the binary or the properties changed, trigger a synchronization
In any case the cache validity check (Retrieval Cache Period) shall be kept.
Since the requested/additional checks are maybe to costly, we suggest to make also this feature configurable as part of the smart remote repo configuration.
Maybe it also makes sense, to distinguish between a necessary sync of the binary and it's properties. Means to only sync the part necessary for the current request.

I've already opened a ticket for our use case around encrypted passwords and removing the ""encrypted password required"" for getEncryptedPassword().

Another thing that would be handy is if the concept of filtered resources could be applied to permissions.

- I programatically create a new artifactory user 
- I create a new set of permissions for that user alone which give them access to a subpath in a specific repo (probably generic in this case)

Said repo will have a lot of folders in it named after each customer/end-user. Instead of having to create per-user permissions, I would love to get able to create a SINGLE permission target:

**/{getCurrentUser()}/*

Currently we log in to the server, grep in the logs.. and if we need to stop a backup or sync we have to manually change the filesystem permissions recursively so that the backup fails. Stopping the Artifactory isn't an option for a production system.

Previously we were able to stop a scheduled backup by changing it's schedule in the configuration, but this is no longer working.

Implementing the ability to retrieve an artifact using rsync would be very helpful.

A simple implementation of this could just be to have a mode where the filestore had a separate ""link tree"" that would match the appearance of the repository browse, but populated with hardlinks to the actual files. This would allow serving up that directory using any standard file service mechanism like rsync/ftp/cifs/etc.

If this would be implemented it would allow people to start loading artifacts into Artifactory without losing their old way of consuming them (assuming that the file shares are read-only most of the time).

There are also some other use case where the export on a NFS/SMB file share is mandatory: like PXE boot, installation kits and ISO images but all these have to be on a file share in order to be able to use them, nobody is able to *run* things from HTTP and downloading them is killing the network.

Currently everything can be done automatically in Artifactory (create repo, create permission and assign repo/group to the permission) except the import of the LDAP group... That has to be done manually.

More flexibility with baseRev and fileItegRev.

As per my experimentation and questions asked to support, it looks like Semantic Version is partially implemented:
All is clear with the {{major.minor.bugfix}} part, as it follows SemVer

Pre-release, SemVer paragraph 9 (see below): 

{quote}9. A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch version. Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphen [0-9A-Za-z-]. Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Numeric identifiers MUST NOT include leading zeroes. Pre-release versions have a lower precedence than the associated normal version. A pre-release version indicates that the version is unstable and might not satisfy the intended compatibility requirements as denoted by its associated normal version. Examples: {{1.0.0-alpha}}, {{1.0.0-alpha.1}}, {{1.0.0-0.3.7}}, {{1.0.0-x.7.z.92}}
{quote}

- We should use a hyphen for pre-release strings. This is fine, and complies with SemVer, but should be in the documentation
- Pre-release strings are sorted lexicographically as a whole. This is not compliant with SemVer, and poses the problem of sorting {{1.0.0-beta2}} and {{1.0.0-beta10}}


{{fileItegRev}} (or Build metadata in to SemVer jargon), SemVer paragraph 10:
{quote}10. Build metadata MAY be denoted by appending a plus sign and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch or pre-release version. Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphen [0-9A-Za-z-]. Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Build metadata SHOULD be ignored when determining version precedence. Thus two versions that differ only in the build metadata, have the same precedence. Examples: {{1.0.0-alpha+001}}, {{1.0.0+20130313144700}}, {{1.0.0-beta+exp.sha.5114f85}}.
{quote}

- Build metadata should be denoted by appending a '\+' sign. This can be done using the appropriate layout, but the Gradle/Ivy/Maved dependency declaration displayed in the GUI (and some REST API calls) will be wrong. Examples using this notation should be in the documentation, since SemVer is a widespread standard. This is my repo layout: {{[orgPath]/[module]/[baseRev]/[module]-[baseRev]+[fileItegRev].ext]}}
- SemVer specifications state that this data should be ignored when determining version precedence, which is fine. We still should be able to sort by build metadata in order to:
** Retrieve the latest build for a given version
** Use the build-in snapshot cleanup

I know this issues could be resolved via custom user plugins, but it's a bit of a waste to spend time developing something that it's already in Artifactory's functionality and should work out of the box.

I've focussed above comments on SemVer, but I think it's not the only standard out there: NuGet uses something a bit different, even it will fully support SemVer in version 3 and Python versioning is also different. For this reason, I think it would be awesome to have _version layouts_ for {{baseRev}} and {{fileItegRev}}. This layouts could provide a regex (already there in repo layouts) and a few rules to compare different versions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|hzsrcn:",,,,,,,UNCOVERED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It seems to me the repodata files need to be recreated at together and they should represent the union of the remote and cache repos.

So artifactory is serving up the cached package which doesn't match the metadata.

To me it seems like we essentially need a virtual repo of the artifactory remote cache, and the remote repo. Unfortunately artifactory doesn't let you use cache repos in a virtual repo.","16/May/17 7:45 PM;cdenneen;Running 4.16.1 and have a virtual yum repo 'epel' setup with remote yum repo 'epel-remote'.
EPEL has a tendency because of storage to delete old versions of packages when new packages get deployed.
So for example:
nodejs-6.10.1-2 is no longer available because nodejs-6.10.2-1 is now available.
Therefore the package metadata has been updated as well.
Our Artifactory however has the nodejs-6.9.1-4, 6.10.1-2, 6.10.2-1 packages but because these aren't available in a repomd.xml they are no longer searchable through yum client pointing at Artifactory. So I think it would be useful for virtual repositories to create their own repomd.xml based on everything it has cached as well as that's available. 

Has anyone found a different workaround for downloading a particular version of a package through Artifactory that has since been removed from the upstream repo? I guess the only other option I could propose is creating some sort of ""epel-backup"" local repo and if remote repositories could have option to move any packages that have been removed upstream, this would allow for a repomd.xml to be generated on the local repo and the package would become available. But this would need to be some sort of automatic process.

I just wanna ask is there any chance that the feature to be implemented? Or any other ideas. thanks","28/Oct/15 12:32 PM;royz;[~Shrike] Hi, There is a way to implement a private VS gallery in Artifactory using a generic private repo.

You will need to:
1. Create a local generic repo and set the repository key, e.g. ""vs-private-gallery"".
2. Upload your gallery.xml to the repository root (make sure that you will set the path to each entry to the relative path under that repository).
3. Upload your vsix files to the repo under desired path (you can also upload the related icons and previews png files)
4. In your VisualStudio open Tools -> Options -> Environment -> Extensions and Update -> Add 
define a name for your gallery and set the URL to the XML file ex : http://<artifacotry url>/vs-private-gallery/gallery.xml and click on apply.
5. In your VS open Tools -> Extensions and Updates -> Select ""Online"", you will see the configured Artifactory gallery and the related extensions.

NOTE:
1. You will need to update the gallery.xml every time you want to upload a new extension.
Hope this helps.
2. Since VS doesn't support authenticated request you MUST enable anonymous access with the relevant permission on the relevant repository.  
","29/Oct/15 10:22 AM;Shrike;@royz Hi, thanks for the suggestion. It's an option for sure. But manually changing gallery.xml on each push is awkward and make it hard to automate publishing from CI builds.","04/May/17 10:46 AM;patrick.finnegan;I was actually going to request the same feature as my team has already tried the suggested solution but it is too manual, it would be a really nice addition to have in Artifactory.
At the moment it is too manual for us to implement on a large scale, yes it can be easily done as a one time job but the only use case for this would be say, hosting legacy extensions.

Using this for extensions that continually receive approved version updates could basically be ruled out as an option due to having to update gallery .xml and each extensions attributes. (and CI builds as Sergei mentioned.)

*This is my first post so I thought I would register my companies interest in the feature should JFrog consider adding support for this. _(I didn't want to open a duplicate request to generate interest, I presume this is the best option)_

As it is this forces us to either always use the --registry option when publishing, or to specify a packageConfig in our package.json files, which is not really very flexible/accurate considering we actually have three local repositories we could publish to.

This is a feature request to implement a ""default publishing"" repository for virtual repositories, so that for instance if I configure NPM in my .npmrc file to use the ""staging"" virtual repository, I can also run ""npm publish"" without any additional arguments and the Artifactory will know to publish to staging-local. This would make our jobs as developers easier and would be more in-line with what the NPM client is expecting. Aside from that the ""--registry"" option is not really well-documented on the NPM website and the NPM developers don't seem very interested in supporting the Artifactory-style workflow into the future  ... (see this discussion when I posted a pull request for better ""npm publish"" documentation: https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/8212 

I'm excited to hear feedback as to whether this feature might be feasible! :)
Otherwise we're pretty happy with the Artifactory support for NPM thus far.

* you cannot set visibility for group, user (is all or nothing now)

Change Permission Management,RTFACT-6863,26096,New Feature,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,felix.herzog,felix.herzog,07/Oct/14 2:34 PM,10/Apr/18 6:53 AM,18/Feb/21 8:48 AM,,3.3.1,,,,,,,,,Security,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,"In Our Company we host one Central Artifactory for all Projects. As we are a full service IT Company and no it-product company all projects are way different with different people...
Each Project we have in our company get’s it’s own set of LOCAL repositories (usually a release repo, one snapshot repo and one 3rd-partylibs-repo for libs that are not on remot erepos.)
These Repos get own permission targets where only special  directory-groups get permission to. 

Each Project gets one or two virtual repositories containing the local repositories and the set of remote/cache repositories they need for successful builds :)

Sadly the current Permission Management does not fit to this scenario because ( ""+"" means: good behaviour; ""-"" means: bad behaviour):
+ Users can only download from repositories they have permission to
+ Users can only deploy to repositories they have permission to
+ users only see local repositories they have permission to
+ users can only see remote/cache repos they have permission to
- Users see ALL Virtual Repositories by name although they have no permission to certain local repositories that are boudn to the virtual one
- user see ALL Builds in the Builds-Browser if they have at least one ""deployer""-permission on one local/remote repository (that's worst)
- adminsitrator must pay good attention by setting up permission target
- adding a LDAP-Group into Artifactory is harmful (import-button etc...)

I'd like to see a permission management system that covers our usage scenario:
permisions for: Build Browser-View-parts (e.G. also ""only license tab for certain users"", permissions for virtual repos (see or not to see), NO IMPORTING of LDAP-Groups (just search them), ...

If you like I can go more in detail but at first I like to hear your opinion if this is a case that may be implemented in future versions or what plans you have.

Thanks,
for us it's more ore less important: As if we want to open a certain instance for customer-access detailed permissions is needed.

To fill in a little extra background on this, the desired use case is to deploy all the eclipse-* maven project artifacts from a Tycho build to an M2 repo with a standard 'mvn deploy'. The eclipse-repository project would be configured to produce a metadata-only archive, and Artifactory would serve a P2 repo from that archive, serving the artifact path requests from the corresponding M2 artifact. This would allow non-OSGi project to build against the artifacts with standard maven without duplicating storage. ","16/Feb/15 2:46 PM;jgeorgeson;I found in Sonatype Nexus OSS there is the 'P2 Metadata Generator' capacity that allows doing a standard 'mvn deploy' of eclipse-feature and eclipse-plugin projects, and the server will publish the jar files to a P2 repo within the M2 repo's storage.

In this case, the build-info json (produced by a TeamCity plugin) simply does not include a ""modules"" top-level property.

So it may be possible to require authentication for build-info (probably jFrog would need to keep this anonymous access option for other customers), but not sure how you would check whether the build-info was associated with a repository and the user requesting access in the scenario of someone publishing build-info, but not publishing artifacts.

Perhaps we could handle this with a plugin that checks if build.json is  missing a modules and decide what we want to do.

jFrog, how might you suggest a plugin would work to filter a build-info request?  Would we be able to force authentication from a plugin using PAPI?

At the moment the only thing I can do in a 'pure' Artifactory world is to publish the legacy _.symbols.nupkg_ packages to a separate feed, configure that as the NuGet source when debugging, then point the Visual Studio debugger at the local NuGet cache to find the PDBs and source from the resolved symbols package.

The most common case for hosting an internal nuget feed is so you can distribute your own private libraries within a software development team and larger product code base. Having symbols is critical for debugging.

This ticket is 7 years old. Could we please get a commitment on this feature to a roadmap, or an explanation, justification, and/or workaround if you will not implement.

Unfortunately, right now to have an alternative UI element, one has to write a fullblown application to do so, deploy another WAR alongside Artifactory or use a mod_proxy HTTP-server in front of Artifactory.

Adding an optional [jsonp|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP] callback parameter would help.

So, e.g., a call to http://repo.jenkins-ci.org/api/search/gavc?g=commons-logging&a=commons-logging&v=1.1.1&callback=myfunction would return something like:
{code}
myfunction({

Now these Projects ask us what remote repos are included to make changes. Maybe they need one more or one less. They do not have the view Sysadmins have on Artiofactory at virtual repository configuration screen.

I ask you to implement a way/view to see what repositories are included for all people or maybe a special group of people.

At least you may implement it into the API first.

A more complex solution would be (the ideal one for us...)
- Add possibility to set ""view"" permission on virtual Repositories (if you do not have this view permission on that virtual repository you neither see it in any search view nor you can see the requested ""inclusions"" list above)
- in ""Browse"" ad a ""virtual repo browse"" where you can see who has that ""view"" permisssion as well what repos are included

Actually, we would like to handle licenses by project, but it seems that Artifactory is not implemeting such a feature, here is a simple use case of what we need to achieve :

??""For example, an artifact with license L_1 used by 2 projects (P_1 & P_2) : P_1 can approve L_1 which means that after deployment, the project administrator won't receive it as unapproved license, but P_2, who didn't approve it, should still get notifications""??


For your information, for each project we are creating a virtual which contains 4 local repos in addition to a list of remote repos used or shared by all the projects virtual repos :

* PROJECT-release-local
* PROJECT-staging-local
* PROJECT-snapshot-local
* PROJECT-thirdParty-local : where third party libraries are uploaded

So, i'm wondering if this could be planned for the next release, thank you

The related issue won't solve this, since we still need a way to access the RPM metadata through the REST API, even if those properties are added during the metadata calculation.

This could be implemented by adding logic to handle something like ""?expand=rpm.info"", or just return it all by default if it exists.

Right now, I have to set artifact properties that duplicate information already available through the UI.

For example, to get an RPM's version, I must first set a ""rpm.version"" property on the artifact after deploying just so I can access it later through the api/search/prop endpoint. Without setting that, I can still get the version through the RPM Info tab, but not through the API.

This ticket is requesting the direct exposure of all of that information through the API.

Thanks","16/Dec/13 9:27 PM;ted.sheibar;Same issue with the ""Builds"" tab that is populated through the Generic Deploy Plugin in Bamboo.

If I want to find the artifact associated with a given build name from Bamboo, I have to set a 'build.name' property at build time in order for that to be queried later. However, I shouldn't have to do that, as the build name is already available through the Builds tab, as well as when viewing the build json.

This further illustrates what I mean. I have to duplicate information that's already available through the UI, when I should be able to access the information Artifactory already has through the API. Does this make sense?

* and continously have to add new exclusions if new repositories are added to artifactory after the cron was added...

Here is more information about our use case for this feature.

We will be using LDAP authentication and authorization with Artifactory.

Many users will be able to access de various repositories with varying access rights. Given that we will be using LDAP, we should control these access using LDAP groups and access définitions within Artifactory defined against these groups. But given the potentially large number of users, we want to take advantage of the organisationnal structure of our company (divisions, directions, services, etc.) and the ""membership"" of the different users within these various organisational units. Unfortunately, this information is not in our LDAP directory. It is available in some other global user database that is unrelated to LDAP. And I do not want to replicate these data within our LDAP repository.

So during the authentication and authorization process, we want Artifactory to consider the LDAP groupes as it does now, but also consider user-group mapping that would be provided by some plugin or plugin hook so that from Artifactory's point of view, the users are part of the groups as defined by the plugin, even though these groups are not real LDAP groups.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thank you for the suggestions, we will debate it internally for the best approach.
As you probably know, the import repository is an additive process, only undeployed artifacts will be imported back into the repository, I also find webdav to be extremely helpful in this scenario, once you mount the repository it is a mater of drag and drop the subtree from your backup.

I have tried it now with the OS X Finder's WebDav support and a few problems arise:

 * For every folder that Finder navigates to, Artifactory dumps a couple WARN lines in the log about some hidden files not being present:

Indeed the OS X Finder don't seems to work as expected and the warnings are him trying to look for the mac DS_Stor files which obviously don't exists on the repository, we are examining if it is somehow Artifactory's fault.
I just verified that GET/PUT/DELETE artifacts and complete drill down works good with different webdav clients (Cyberduck on mac, Bitkinex on Windows) so please give it another go using a different client.

I did run into one bit of oddness: I started out with Cyberduck 4.0.2 and was able to copy artifacts between repos.

No bells, 4.2.1 and Tomcat works for me.
1. Do you see anything related in the artifactory.log, request.log?

When a project migrates from a legacy build system to a system with dependency management (Maven/Ivy) one of the first tasks is to migrate the dependencies committed to source control to dependencies in Artifactory. Many of the dependencies in source control do not have version information, so they need to be searched in Artifactory (or on the Internet).

This is a huge manual task, and it would be a great idea to provide a search by hash page, so that an user could upload a file or a checksum and Artifactory could return the groupId:artifactId:classifier:version of the artifact found.

In my opinion this would be a great selling point for migrating projects ;)

About the feature - both search by file and search by hash should be implemented, since sometimes the Artifactory server is in a distant location, and only providing a file upload method would be very slow (even though it is more direct and intuitive). The search by hash would be much faster.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"20/Oct/10 2:34 PM;costin;checksum-search.png;https://www.jfrog.com/jira/secure/attachment/12756/checksum-search.png",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|hzscun:",,,,,,,UNCOVERED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"20/Oct/10 2:34 PM;costin;A mockup of a checksum search interface.","14/Nov/11 7:24 PM;ttres;This issue is broader than RTFACT-2436.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What if Artifactory could be instructed to periodically monitor a specified third-party versions and download it in advance when a new one is ready?
For example, we use *{{""org.jvnet.hudson.main:hudson-war""}}* in our builds and each time a new version is released, I update a POM with Hudson version and then wait quite a lot while Artifactory downloads it from remote repos, war size is ~30Mb. 

Instead, I could specify this *{{""<gId><aId>""}}* combination to be monitored for updates and eagerly downloaded the moment a new version becomes available. This way, when I come to the office, I already have new Hudson war in our internal Artifactiory repo. Optionally, an e-mail with a download link and <dependency> snippet can be sent.

Full mirroring between local and remote repositories,RTFACT-2641,17153,New Feature,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,yoavl,costin,costin,14/Jan/10 6:01 PM,27/Apr/14 7:53 PM,18/Feb/21 8:48 AM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,"Hello,

A very useful feature of Artifactory would be full mirroring between a specified local repository and a remote repository. This should work like this:
1. create a local repository
2. check a box saying ""Mirror a remote repository""
3. check a box for ""Full mirroring (upload locally deployed artifacts and delete locally deployed artifacts)""
4. activate a textbox for the url
5. if the ""full mirroring"" checkbox is on, activate textboxes for user and password

On the initial setup copy everything from the remote repository. A deploy to the local repo should trigger a deploy to the remote repository. A local deletion or move should trigger the same thing remotely. For move to another repo, probably this should be treated as a deletion from the remote repository - unless the full mirroring is activated, in which case the artifact should be moved remotely too, if the equivalent repository is found (if not, put a warning in the server logs).

For conflicts - SNAPSHOTs - just take the newest version. For releases - same (I'm not sure Artifactory holds timestamps for these). 
There are probably lots of issues related to timeouts and other types of conflicts which need to be treated...

This would be a big development, I agree, that's why I present it more as wishlist item.

This would be very useful for multi-site deployment - i.e. corporations or organizations with multiple headquarters.

It would definitely be very-very useful for us.

In the case of maven and ALM in general it is especially power - to demonstrate here is how we are using them to support distrubuted s/w development:

All our s/w dev projects have a dedicated project portal or 'project home' (think sourceforge's project homes, but enhanced) and one this project home page is a funky RSS feed display (think a nice table with tabs) that  displays the unified activity being reported from the main development support systems via their RSS feeds into one combined chronoligical view. Thus to what's been going on with your project over the last few days (say 5) one simply looks at this table. Aswell as showing the RSS feeds in combined view ordered by time, we also expose each specific system's activity (RSS feed) in its own dedicated activity tab.

We currently have feeds coming from the following tools:

Task activity (JIRA) - Project progress, new bugs etc
Wiki activity (confluence) - Design and general collaboration
Version control activity (Subversion) - commits et al
Build activity (QuickBuild) - CI builds, etc
Forum activity (JiveForums) - Team as well as public threads

So guess what i want to add to this list? Yep, deployments to maven repository and as I am considering changing from Proximity to Artifactory I would very much like this kind of web 2.0 (plse excuse this unadltered use of a stupid marketing misnomer) feature.

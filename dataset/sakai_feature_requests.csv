What happens?","25-Jun-2018 14:46;wilma@longsight.com;When sending grades for an assignment to an existing gradebook item, there is no warning to the user in assignments. It lets you associate the grades with the item even if there is a points mismatch. I tested it with an assignment worth 100 and a gradebook item worth 10. When you grade the assignment, the gradebook does alert the user that the grade is more than the points possible on the item. (See images attached)

It should be noted that associating an assignment with an existing gradebook item is not the preferred way of adding assignments to the gradebook. Typically, users select the ""add assignment to gradebook"" option to make a new gradebook item when creating the assignment. In this case the points value comes from the assignment itself so they always match.","21-Jun-2019 12:33;tkelsey2;[~jonespm], when you do this with a rubric, the point total from the rubric will be applied to the number of points entered for the gradebook, so if you make a gradebook item worth 10 points and attach a rubric totalling to 100 points, even if the student gets 50/100 on the rubric, they will get 500% in the gradebook.

Idea for increasing the size of resource id,SAK-39503,70595,New Feature,OPEN,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project.

SAK-11816
SAK-11020

The field resource_id (and related fields) in the content tables has remained a small 255 characters since the beginning of Sakai. The main problem now is that this limits the length of file names and directory structures since that entire information is stored in the resource id. Previously it was also a problem for URL's but that was ""fixed"" in 2.7. (Even though the fix involved actually creating a file which introduced problems of it's own such as importing a tool like Lessons without importing it's content) 

It looks like historically it's remained that low because of Mysql. Prior to 5.0.3 the varchar was limited to 255 characters. That makes sense. Then the index was also limited to 737 bytes (255*3 for UTF-8). However in more recent versions, the index of InnoDB tables is allowed to be as large as 3072 bytes (1024*3) and the varchar limitation is up to 65K. Oracle still has the 4K limit which is larger than both and should be safe to increase now, but should probably still stay in the same limit for consistency.

So it seems like we could safely increase these id's where they are used up to the MySQL maximum of 1024, giving us a little more room on these ids. Anything else seems like it would require a more creative solution (which may or may not be worked on)

Any feedback on this?

I'm sure there's even more creative solutions as the way we store content in the database is really inefficient but the focus on that ended years ago with JCR. With MySQL 5.7.7+ the large_prefix is the default so that makes it easy, it looks like anyone lower would have to set it in their configuration. This is the instructions on Drupal for utf8mb4 support (which is semi related to this) https://www.drupal.org/node/2754539

It might be possible for Sakai to detect if large prefixes are available and use a different hibernate mapping (and also different limits) while also warning the user they should set these for increased limits.

I would like to mention few enhancements in tests and quizzes. 

1. Currently no option to specify the Pass Mark for an exam is available. It will be nice to have it in Tests and Quizzes itself. Currently we have to depend the GradeBook tool for identifying the passed students. The pass mark (%) can vary for different exams and hence it is good to have this in Exam Settings itself. 

2. Assigning a credit point for passed students :  For some certification courses or some staff development programs, it is used to give a credit point for those who passed certain exam. For example: A continuing education program is conducted for staff nurses in a hospital. Every week an online exam is being conducted. For those who pass the exam some credit is given which will be added to their performance/appraisal variables. 
It is not an extra mark which is added to the scored mark. Example: For those who passed Exam1, say a credit point '2' is given.

Hope you get the picture. 

Thanks!

First page now includes 10 pages, 

Current page is in red (#FF0000)

Subsequent page numbers are in standard link blue, without an underline. Page numbers are well spaced out for people with motor control difficulties. 

'Next page' takes the person to the next page - so from page 1, it takes them to page 2. 

A forward arrow appears between the numbers and the 'newxt page' . Clicking this has the same effect as clicking 'next page'. (Icon is Silk result_set_next)

Note that the same links would be shown in the same style at the bottom of the page too. ","09-Jan-2008 09:15;hmtruscott;This is the final page of results

The previous 10 pages are displayed. 

The 'previous' link takes you to the page before the one you are currently on. Thus on page 20, clicking 'previous' takes you to page 19.

The arrow icon (result_set_previous) takes you to the same page as 'previous' link

It is 'previous' rather than 'previous page' for reasons of space, and because I think that there's a little more confusion about what these links will take you to (i.e. is it next 10 results? next page?) when you start than by the time you've got to the final results page. ","09-Jan-2008 09:17;hmtruscott;When you're in the middle of your search resutls, you see both 'previous' and 'next page' links, and both arrows. Again, our current page is indicated in red, with others in blue. 

Google puts its numbers above 10 very close together, which allows 21 numbers to fit onto the page. 

I always feel a little bit uncomfortable about how close the Google numbers are - for clarity and for people with motor difficulties, I'd prefer to have 8 numbers either side, better spaced out, as shown on this screen.

'next page' v 'previous' isn't consistent with Google - I'm not saying that Google necessarily made the right decision here, but we do know it's the de-facto standard and what our users will probably expect.

So, on page N clicking 'next page' should take you onto page N + 1, not page N + 10 as it currently does.

On page N, clicking 'previous' should take you to page N - 1, not page N - 10.  I'd have a lower-case letter starting 'previous' for consistency.

Clicking on the arrow should have the same behaviour. 

I'd go for a width of 15 and with the 'centre' behaviour.

Not certain about the paging (next and previous), after testing here is why.

If next does current page+1 and previous does current page -1 .....

why do we remove previous when the first page in the list is page 0 and the current page is page 7 ?

previous-1 would be 6 which is valid so the control is valid

at the other end on page 93 (100 pages) we are not displaying next but page+1 is valid.

If N = CP+1 and P = CP-1 then it makes no sense to hide them except when the page is 0 or 99 and
the possition of next and previous is wrong and should be beside the current page.


IMHO, next and previous are rapid scrolling controls that jump so that the current page becomes the page just beyond the last one shown.

Date Manager > Place Tab in Respective Tools ,SAK-44478,88681,New Feature,OPEN,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project.

This feature request does not wish to disturb this approach at all, as many instructors will continue to find value in a one-stop-shop approach.

This feature request, however, proposes to further expand the availability of this feature, by *also* placing a ""Date Manager"" tab within the respective tools it governs. And the proposal here is that it will allow for the adjustment of dates for that specific tool only. 

For example, if a Date Manager tab were added in the Resources tool, then a user would only be able to adjust availability dates in bulk locally for Resources. As of now, an instructor would need to ""leave"" Resources and go to Site Info, just to modify availability dates in bulk in Resources. This seems counter-intuitive. 

I've placed a few mock-up images to provide the general idea below.

Now, if this feature request comes to fruition, then any changes that the instructor makes in Site Info would need to be accessible, viewable, and modifiable in the local area as well – and vice versa. 

This offers instructors a two-pronged approach to managing dates in bulk. Either, instructors can do it in a one-stop-shop approach (which can be useful in certain contexts), or they could do it on the tool-only-based approach. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SAK-32062,SAK-31876,,,,,,,,"14-Oct-2020 16:59;jbuckin2;Resources Date Manager 2.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/57053/Resources+Date+Manager+2.png","14-Oct-2020 16:59;jbuckin2;Resources Date manager.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/57052/Resources+Date+manager.png",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,,,,"0|10cba0:",9223372036854775807,,"Go to the resources tool or any other tool that has availability dates.

Even though I'm aware of what it does, even knowing that the tool is capable of having dates implemented for items, I would be confused by that tab as a user.  I think Resources needs a Visibility Manager instead, to include a table where you can bulk edit all forms of visibility for content with them enabled (hidden, hidden but allow access to contents for folders, visible at specific dates, group-restricted).

Also, noting that I haven't tested the functionality, if you select a ""hidden"" option on a file or folder and then try to enable a visibility date restriction, it has no effect - how does the date manager handle this?

Just want to keep this conversation alive. The idea here is to have a feature/property that allows institutions to enable/disable ""Grade this Assignment"" by default in the new Assignments UI within Sakai 20/21. 

Use Case: 

Our thinking is that instructors are used to seeing the Grade Scale, Points, Gradebook options, and Peer assessment options in the UI as-is, without needing to click a check-box to reveal them. We want to be sure that there is a way to enable ""Grade this Assignment"" by default on our end, so instructors don't miss these important steps in creating an assignment. I also think that most assignments will likely be graded, so I'd rather have instructors opt out of grading than opt in to grade. 

I believe this feature would also be of value to other institutions as well.

I just wanted to check in again on this. I'm hoping we can secure a way to enable this by default. Most instructors, in my view, will want to grade their assignment. 

This Jira says its ""awaiting information,"" but I'm not sure what other information is needed.","28-Apr-2020 08:20;sfoster9;Looks like the questions have been answered, so I'm opening this feature request.","28-Apr-2020 11:57;jbuckin2;[~sfoster9], Thanks so much!","28-Apr-2020 19:44;alanregan;I'm sorry to ask this question, but who made this interface change and why was it done?

Overall, the mantra should be to reduce clicks, not add clicks.

If the majority of instructors grade assignments for points (which is our institutional experience), then the default should be set there.  In fact, by hiding the point value field, at first glance I thought that there was a bug!

Please either:
 * Restore the previous interface
 * Or check the ""grade this assignment"" by default so Points is the selection

Thank you!","29-Apr-2020 22:29;sfoster9;We (Western) made the change to this section of the page in SAK-42354. 

I agree: where possible, we should reduce the number of clicks. And I believe we have reduced at least one click with this new process. 

Before, an instructor had to:
# click on the Grade Scale dropdown menu
# click Points option in the dropdown
# click the Add Assignment to Gradebook checkbox

Now, an instructor has to:
# click the ""Grade this assignment"" checkbox
#* Points option is already selected by default 
# click ""Send grades to the Gradebook""
#* The ""Create new Gradebook item"" is selected by default

If the instructor wants the assignment to be associated with an existing Gradebook item, the number of clicks are equal to the old interface. 

The approach we took when designing this change was to better guide the instructor through the options through the use of hierarchy, in order to reduce the cognitive load on the instructor to have to remember or determine whether (or how) one option relates to another. We've been running this change locally for over a year now and I have not heard of any complaints about the change.

The new approach also reduces the chances for errors by guiding them through the options rather than allowing them to choose an option that then requires an error message display.

I am not against adding an option about whether the setting to ""Grade this Assignment"" is enabled by default.

University of Murcia considers the development of a tool that allows students to keep track of the time spent on the tasks that teachers create in Sakai. Students must be able to perform this action via web or mobile devices through specific applications. In addition, the management of tasks, subjects and so, must be integrated with Sakai, and an administration panel must be allowed so that instructors can manage the data provided, issue reports, etc.

*Context*
One of the main issues that university degree programs are facing nowadays is adjusting the workload that students must devote to a subject according to the different formative activities of which it is composed.

Within the Assignments tool we suggest the addition of a new tab ""Work Log"" in which students can add the time they are spending on a task before even creating a draft of it, being independent of the submissions or drafts that they may make.
- The student view must show the time spent on a specific task and what you have spent it on.
- The instructor's view should show the time each student has spent separately and a statistic of the general time of all of the students, being also able to detect those students that are being left behind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,,,,"0|10c2x4:",9223372036854775807,,,,,Not started,,,,,,,"03-Jun-2020 09:12;jonespm;Sounds a little like features in Jira that allow you to track lime

Issue description with example use cases

h3. Allowing completion of a test for multiple students with technical issues

An instructor creates a timed test, e.g., with a 2-hour time limit, that has some flaw in a question making it impossible for students to complete.  A significant number of students start the test (e.g., 50 students) and they work on it for quite a while, e.g., 1 hour, then encounter the question with an issue.  The students can't complete the test before it is automatically saved and submitted by the timer.

The instructor can allow another submission, but then the students *have to start over* from scratch, with the full 2-hour time limit.  In most cases like these, the instructor just wants to let the students *finish what they started*.  In the example provided above, the instructor would want to:
# Set a date/time exception for the students to allot 1 hour for the ""continued"" test.
# Let the students have all their answers from the initial submission already included, so they can pick up where they left off, answering the remaining questions.

Similarly, if an instructor creates some date/time exceptions in a test and makes a mistake in the dates/time limits, they might need to allow the affected students a bit more time to complete it.

This issue has come up multiple times recently as many instructors and students are new to teaching online and using _Tests & Quizzes_.

h3. Allowing students to improve on subsequent attempts

As per SAK-34754, an instructor wants to let students submit an assessment and see which questions they answered correctly/incorrectly, without revealing the correct answers (e.g., by showing student response and question point values as feedback).  Then, allow the students to take it again and try to correct the answers to questions they got wrong to improve their score.

h2. Proposed fix

In _Settings_, after enabling more than 1 submission, have a checkbox to allow students with multiple submissions the ability to see their answers submitted during the last take when they submit again, e.g.:
{quote}Students will start each new submission with their responses from their last attempt already entered.{quote} 

*Important:* The wording and how the instructor selects these options must be *easy to understand* and *accessible*.

h2. Additional notes

Samigo has an existing option *Allow students to update their latest submission* to present students with a new take prefilled with their previous answers (this is *not* a new submission - the option specifically backs their last submission out of being submitted!)  The option is available if the instructor selects *Edit* > *Regrade and Republish* for an assessment, but for the use case described here, it's an *extremely* poor substitute and a clunky workaround.

If you select the checkbox *Allow students to update their latest submission* when republishing a test, it *removes all student submissions*.  Then *all students* in the class *must* resubmit the test in order for their submission to count.

The other problem with the *Allow students to update their latest submission* option is that if there was a time limit on the original assessment, you *cannot* use the option in concert with any time limit at all.  You *must* remove the time limit altogether *before* enabling the option.  Otherwise, when a student tries to continue the test, it recognizes that the original timer thread already expired and immediately submits it without giving the student any opportunity to work on it.",,,,,,,,,,SAK-43614,,,,,,,,,,,,SAK-34754,SAK-44779,,,,,,,,"10-Nov-2020 09:16;davidpbauer;choice_retake_re-entry.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/57329/choice_retake_re-entry.png","10-Nov-2020 09:16;davidpbauer;re-entry_settings.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/57330/re-entry_settings.png","10-Nov-2020 09:15;davidpbauer;retake_re-entry_link.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/57328/retake_re-entry_link.png","10-Nov-2020 13:32;davidpbauer;standard_due_time.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/57336/standard_due_time.png",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,,,,"0|10c68w:",9223372036854775807,,"*Note:* Additional regression testing will be needed.

# In *Settings*, enable the following:
** A relatively short time limit, e.g., *10 min*.
** *Feedback on submission* with the following feedback options (this is a test for instructors who want students to be able to see what they got wrong after the first take):
*** Student Response
*** Student's Question and Part Scores
# Publish the quiz.
# As Student 1, start the quiz, save some answers (not all) and don't submit.  Let the timer submit.
# As Student 2, answer all the questions and submit it manually, getting some answers correct and some incorrect.
# As instructor select *Settings* for the quiz.
# Enable a time exception for each student, e.g. decrease the time to *5 min*.
# Change the _number of submissions allowed_ to *3*.
# Enable the option *If multiple submissions or a retake are allowed, students will start each new submission with their responses from their last attempt already entered.*
# *Save* the settings.
# Log in as Student 1 and go to _Tests & Quizzes_.
# Start the second submission and confirm the following:
** You get the appropriate (new) time limit.
** All your previous answers are pre-populated.
# Finish answering the rest of the questions and submit the quiz.
# Confirm you can take it a third time, now with all the answers from your most recent take included and the appropriate time limit.
# As Student 2, log in and check the Feedback to see all your answers and figure out which questions you got wrong.
# Take the quiz again, confirming that you have the appropriate time limit, all your answers are included, and you can change the answers to try to get them all right, then submit.
# Take the quiz a third time, confirming that the answers from the most recent attempt are included.

h2. Verification of submissions/scores
# As instructor go to *Scores* for each quiz and confirm that the student's recorded grade on _Total Scores_ for each quiz is appropriate based on the scoring settings in the exam (typical default is *highest submission*).
# From the _View_ menu, select *All Submissions* and confirm you can access the students' original attempts (for Student 1, the partial attempt should be present).

We are almost finished but took a different approach than what is detailed in this ticket. In our version, we've updated the retake feature to allow instructors to choose if they'd like a student to ""re-enter"" their exam or start a new submission. The next page allows them to set a time limit for re-entry and a new due date.
1. Allow retake / re-entry
 !retake_re-entry_link.png|thumbnail! 
2. Select retake or re-entry page
 !choice_retake_re-entry.png|thumbnail! 
3. Enter re-entry settings
 !re-entry_settings.png|thumbnail! ","10-Nov-2020 13:20;rainribbon;[~davidpbauer] I think the terminology shown in the screenshots is confusing, particularly if you are not actually creating a unique, new submission with the ""re-entry"".

Here is a list of the words used by instructors at UVA in emails requesting this feature:

* Resume
* Reopen
* Continue
* Finish
* Complete

Based on this list, I would prefer the word ""Reopen"" to ""Re-enter"", e.g.:

On _Submission Information_ page, link: *Allow retake or reopen assessment*

On _Allow Retake or Reopen Assessment_ page:
Would you like to allow the student to retake the assessment, or reopen it for them to continue?
* *Allow Retake* - Allow the student to retake the assessment, starting from scratch with a blank submission.
* *Reopen for Submission* - Allow the student to continue taking the assessment with their previous answers available and complete their submission.

On the _Reopen Assessment_ page:

As per SAK-34323, all date fields, time limit selections, etc. for exceptions and on any other pages should behave *exactly* the same as the standard fields for setting availability.  Please don't propagate the existing horrible exceptions UI to other pages!

Like the standard date/time settings for assessments, there should be a checkbox for enabling the time limit.  If unchecked, there's no time limit.  All dates, time limits, etc. that are already enabled on the assessment overall or as an exception for the specified student need to be *pre-populated* into the fields on this page.
","10-Nov-2020 13:39;davidpbauer;Thanks, Tiffany. We typically finish UI / wording work last as it can change based on the final workflow for a new feature. So, none of what you see in the screenshots are final except for the steps to reopen a submission. I do like your suggestion of using reopen instead of re-entry throughout the entire feature.

Can you elaborate on what you mean by it should behave the exact same way as the standard fields? Do you mean like this? 
!standard_due_time.png|thumbnail! 
Or do you just mean that there should be the checkbox to disable the time limit?

In our version of this feature, we are making the reopen available immediately with a due date (and optional time limit) set by the instructor when they reopen the submission. There is no open date, retract date, and the overall time limit is irrelevant because you set the *additional* time you want to allow for the student. So, all of the other dates / times seem pointless on this page because they wouldn't do anything. Perhaps I'm missing a use case where you would need more than just a due date and optionally a time limit for when an instructor only wants the student to have 10 minutes to finish up regardless of the original time limit for the exam.
","10-Nov-2020 13:42;davidpbauer;The last thing we are exploring with this is grading. Do we expect instructors to have to regrade the entire submission that was reopened (i.e. all grades/comments removed), regrade only the questions where the answer was changed, keep all of the grades that were entered, or something else?","28-Jan-2021 16:40;jloudiana;Is it possible to add the grades or have it go in as a separate and the instructor can then do an override on the test and combine them?

We have this request all the time due to internet drops, Respondus glitches as well as timer just running out especially for students who should have an exception and somehow the except wasn't given an instructor can just add the time to the quiz for them to finish it out.

THANKS!","28-Jan-2021 17:53;rainribbon;[~davidpbauer] I was thinking that the due date and time limit options should be the same as on the _Settings_ page, where the dates/time limits are pre-populated with the settings specified for the assessment overall (kind of like how _Assignments_ *Allow Resubmission* feature on the grading page pre-populates the resubmission date when you check the box).

Thanks for clarifying about the ""allow X amount of extra time"" (regardless of the assessment's original time limit) option. I would still prefer that the options be more like the following (not sure about the defaults, and some of the text below is a very rough draft and would need to be edited) to match the [Assessment Settings label suggestions doc|https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HUAlUN5U1cKe9H5nmOoTtdwpKhe5XQ7g/edit] for suggested rewrite to labels in settings page

When will the reopened assessment be available?
 * Available (required) [date field pre-populated with original assessment or student's exception available date ??]
 (mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm)
 * Due [date field pre-populated with original assessment or student's exception due date ??]
 (mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm)
 * What is the final submission deadline?
 ** The due date (No late submissions allowed)
 ** Accept a late submission for the reopened assessment. Submission deadline: [date field pre-populated with original assessment or student's exception late submission date ??]
 (mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm)
 * Limit the amount of extra time allowed to take the reopened assessment?
 ** No. Allow the student to take the assessment from the available date until the submission deadline.
 ** Yes. Extra time allowed: [hour selection] hrs [minute selection] min

I'd prefer the UI to match the normal date-setting UI because:
 * The instructor might not want to reopen the assessment immediately. For example, an instructor might want to schedule a reopen date to be something like ""tomorrow, at the start of class time"".
 * What if the instructor wants the submission to the reopened assessment to be marked LATE? If the instructor is unable to set a retract date separate from the due date, won't all submissions of reopened assessments fall automatically within the range of ""not late""?  I can see value in setting the available date to the original assessment available date (even if it is in the past), the due date to the assessment's due date (even if it is in the past), and the submission deadline to the future, and having the submission marked LATE.
 * Setting a time limit to 00 h 00 min to make the assessment untimed is counterintuitive to users - it should be a yes or no option (and if yes, then you specify the desired limit).

Regarding grading, I think only auto-graded questions should be automatically regraded (similar to how retracting, editing, and regrading and republishing works).  If the instructor entered comments for any questions before reopening the assessment, the comments should be retained, as well as previously-entered grades for any manually-graded questions (e.g., short answer/essay, audio response, and file upload).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Is there any way to NOT have ckeditor save pasted in images (or source with base64) as an embedded base64 image?  And instead, automatically add the image to resources and have the ckeditor source link to it?

This plugin looks like it might have some of those features:

https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/imagepaste

In our case, we have a class that uses Etudes Meme - Assignments, Tests, Surveys (but I suspect this could happen with Samigo too) and it has 1000s of questions in several question pools.  Many of those questions contain base64 images, which I suspect the instructor pasted into ckeditor.  And I think because of the base64 images, we're seeing some slow queries accessing that tool for that site.

Also, that instructor imports those tests from one semester to the next so the problem continues to happen each semester.  It would be great if we could automatically convert those existing base64 images into an actual file in resources and link to it from the test. (otherwise, we'd have to ask the instructor to manually convert each image into a resources image link)

I also suspect that many sites have pasted in bas64 images into their Overview tool -> Worksite Information.

Therefore, the rubric doesn't necessarily attach to a submission or a group. It is the grade for that student for that item. 

However, from an instructor's perspective, a rubric could be used to grade a group of students all at once, so each student gets a copy of that rubric. But then each student gets their own individual copy of that rubric. 

As we discussed on today's Sakai Core team, we need our tools to better handle grades between the Gradebook and other tools so that grades are all handled the same. This is the goal of the centralized grading service project. 

Therefore, my opinion is that we make rubrics work for a group without any individual changes/rubric overrides (so each student in the group can see the graded rubric) and then, once the centralized grading service project is in place, we take another look at how to allow rubric overrides for individual students of a group and indicating that override to the instructor from the group's initial rubric. ","11-Oct-2019 07:30;profmikegreene;Sorry I missed this discussion Tuesday, it does seem ripe for the 10/16 T&L call IMO. Here are the use cases I consider requirements if we're saying we're going to support individual and group rubrics.
 * individual assignments can use rubrics and have grade adjustments
 * group assignments with a single submission can use a single group-wide rubric and have grade adjustments for the entire group
 * group assignments with a single submission can use a single group-wide rubric and have grade adjustments for individuals
 * group assignments with a single submission can use individual rubrics and have grade adjustments for individuals

It seems like Earle's #3 suggestion would allow for all these b/c the item being evaluated is dictated by each of these use cases, is that what you're saying [~ern]? Does that method also flow to how the grading service would interact with individual vs group assignments?

If I understand them correctly, I agree with Shawn's comments above and what he's stating would allow these use cases. The rubric is focused on providing a uniform method of evaluation across all groups/individuals submitting an -assignment- assessment and the grading service and grader ui is used for overriding an individual's grade outside of the rubric for both individual and group -assignments- assessment that use a rubric. This also seems more efficient since if you put the override logic in the rubric, don't you have to recreate it in the grader ui create another layer of abstraction for -assignments- assessments that don't use a rubric?

Here's how [gradescope UI does it|[https://www.gradescope.com/assets/help_center/rubric_overview-d5410cf1f3f9f5722f8edc9ef901683a3b6872be087c7e8e37fe4116f7c2f8d8.png]] which I quite like, but I need to test their group assignment feature more to know how they handle this situation.","16-Oct-2019 09:20;psg3a@virginia.edu;T&L consensus is for option #3","16-Oct-2019 11:52;ern;follow up to [~profmikegreene] comment

Option 3 would allow for the following with respect to group submissions:
 * key concept is a 1 to 1 link between rubric and the item being evaluated (i.e. a submission and not the user)
 * group assignments with a single submission can use a single group-wide rubric and have grade adjustments for the entire group.
 ** The rubric is for grading the item and adjustments to the rubric are in effect for that item
 ** Assignments uses the score as calculated by the rubric but it also adds the ability to adjust that score separately
 * group assignments with a single submission can use a single group-wide rubric and have grade adjustments for individuals
 ** Rubrics does not provide individual grading to members of the group (i.e. individual rubric for each member of the group)
 ** Assignments however does allow for grade override. Entering a value in the grade override would be overriding the score from the rubric
 * group assignments with a single submission can use individual rubrics and have grade adjustments for individuals
 ** again Rubrics does not provide individual grading to members of the group (i.e. individual rubric for each member of the group)
 ** Assignments however does allow for grade override.

 

Visual depiction:

In a non group assignment a submission looks like 
{noformat}
(Rubric <-> [Submission) <-> User]{noformat}
therefore we can say
{noformat}
(Rubric <-> User){noformat}
----
In a single group submission assignment it looks like
{noformat}
(Rubric <-> [Submission) <-> {User1, User2, UserN}]{noformat}
therefore a rubrics relationship for the users looks like
{noformat}
(Rubric <-> {User1, User2, UserN}){noformat}
as you can see adding user centric criterion would not be ideal in this case because each user would be receiving the same rating.

This should answer the question about using a rubric that includes a user centric Criterion (i.e. Participation) and as you can see it would be a bad choice to do this for group based submissions. We should include some text to advise against doing this for group based assignment submissions.

Some grading methods will allow you to use this trick to enter a negative score for a criterion.  This should be made consistent across all tools.

Current behaviors: 
 * Tests & Quizzes - Grading by student: Can not enter a negative number for a criterion. Gives a warning ""Value must be greater than or equal to zero""
 * Tests & Quizzes - Grading by question: Can enter a negative number for a criterion. If the overall score is negative, rounds up to zero**** Doesn't actually allow you to advance to next question until the negative is removed.
 * Assignments - Classic Grader: Can enter a negative number for a criterion. Can not enter a score below 0. 
 * Assignments - New grader: SAK-44480.  Currently does not save, with no warning.
 * Gradebook: Allows negative criterion. Rounds negative scores up to zero.
 * Forums: Gives a warning ""Value must be greater than or equal to zero"". If you close this without resetting the criterion, the Gradebook shows the points without the negative, and the rubric shows the penalty, with the points subtracted. Points between the rubric and gradebook don't match.

* How can this be implemented in a keyboard- and screen-reader accessible way?  Would it ""lock in"" your tabbing/arrowing through the grades table so that your tab or arrow keys only made you navigate from one editable empty cell to another?

Additional Questions/Caveats

How would this feature work with ""locked"" items provided by external tools, e.g., Tests & Quizzes, Assignments?  Possible thoughts:
* Place the user's focus on the lock icon for the empty.  Upon clicking the lock icon, offer a link to jump directly to the grade page for the corresponding quiz/assignment.
* If an option to jump from Gradebook to an assignment or quiz grade page is developed, include that option on clicking ANY lock icon for ANY assignment/quiz.

This is counterintuitive to users -
 you don't need to enable the editor elsewhere in Sakai, and the variability of the links across question types is also confusing (see SAM-3260).

This is a feature request to simply display the editor automatically for all text fields available to the instructor. Reasons for this are below.

# Samigo is the only place you need to manually enable the editor to use it.
# The editor is required for even basic formatting, and most instructors don't know they need to enable it before authoring a question (e.g. paragraph breaks silently fail to save if you enter them in the text boxes).
# CKEditor does not open by default on editing a question with rich text content. 
 This is a big problem for any instructors trying to use images or LaTeX in question pool questions because accessing a question within a pool causes you to edit it.  The editors are not visible on accessing the question and the rich text content is garbled into HTML tags.
# SAM-3260 - Concerns have been raised regarding the inconsistency in the UI of the *Show Rich-Text Editor* vs. *Show All Rich-Text Editors* links.  Although the *Show All* link is helpful to open all editors when authoring a multiple choice questions, it's awkwardly placed (above the question text box) if you just want to enter rich text content in a feedback box at the bottom of the screen.

There are multiple screens in instructor authoring (*Working Copies*, *Published Copies*, AND *Question Pools*) that include the *Show Editor* type links.  All of these screens will need testing/verification after the change is made.  Additionally, the rich text output in student delivery and feedback will need to be verified.

I believe this Jira would make Samigo worse from the UX perspective. I.e.

I believe the more CKeditors are opened the more difficult is to handle the question. Please see this [video|https://umubox.um.es/index.php/s/V18vTv1XEBZsQbx] to check it. Regards,

","20-Nov-2018 16:17;rainribbon;While it does make for large boxes on the screen, making the CKEditor available by default solved all of the problems I list at the bottom of this comment.  Ideally, there would be a way to make the editors show but be less obnoxiously large (like use the editor but only a few buttons, and allow the user to click a link right on that editor to access all its other buttons).

I should note that we have not received a single complaint from an instructor about removing the links and just showing the editors by default, which we did back in July.  Meanwhile, several instructors encountered issues #3 and 4 below before we made the change.  Furthermore, in working with instructors, I often heard complaints about having to click the links because they found it annoying.
 # Instructors (authoring and grading) and students (taking tests) were often confused by how to put in rich-text content.
 # The option to Show All Rich-Text Editors for Multiple Choice questions was in a location that didn't make sense if you wanted to use rich-text in just one answer option or in the Feedback boxes - you had to know to go all the way to the top of the page to access it (see also SAK-34342).
 # Entering non-standard characters (e.g., &, letters with accent marks) in question/answer text without first enabling the editors, then editing the question, would result in HTML code for that character displaying in the question/answer text.
 # When instructors used LaTeX math in a question in a question pool, and then edited the question, the CKEditors were not displaying by default and they would end up with broken question text (essentially same issue as #3 but more prominent in a question pool because you can't even view a question without editing it).","21-Nov-2018 06:50;lcira;[~rainribbon] If we could offer the minimized palette (as you mention in your opening paragraph in yesterday's comment) I think that could be a good compromise.

Some instructors also use the fontawesome icons as a workaround for the SAK-40527.  Finally, if a weird formatting issue thanks to copying and pasting from Word or a webpage affects a question, we Support folks may need access to the Source to assist with fixing it.

Some users are confronted with a request to download the video/audio files when arriving on the page where they are embedded.  Others are asked to enable Flash.

The proposal is to add Able Player, an open-source accessible HTML5 media player, to Sakai for these embeds.

[Github link for Able Player|https://ableplayer.github.io/ableplayer/]

Ideally:
* The AblePlayer would also be available as a CKEditor plugin so it could be used for CKEditor video/audio embeds.  However, it doesn't look like they make a CKEditor plugin.
* Anywhere users can upload attachments, and they upload a video/audio file, its mimetype would be recognized as such and embedded on the page with a corresponding Download link to allow for download if needed.

*Related questions:*
* How does the user upload captions for a video/audio file they upload, and where do the captions files get stored?
* If there are multiple tracks/elements, how do those get uploaded and stored?

ISSUE

New students become confused when they see the red warning ""You must post to this topic before you can view any messages"" when a professor has enabled the ""Require users to post before reading"" option.

Since the ""Start a New Conversation"" button that they need to use is at the top of the tool (and not near the topic or the error message), they often don't know how to resolve the problem.  They also see the ""red"" box, interpret the issue as a system problem and ask the professor for help.

If the activity was accessed through a link from the Lessons tool, the embedded Forum view within Lessons is very cluttered.  This makes the ""Start a New Conversation"" button even more difficult to locate.
h1. SUGGESTIONS

Modify the message.  Change the format from red to blue or yellow as an informational item rather than an error message. Also, provide the specific action that the student needs to take in the warning message.

Example:

""This topic requires that you post a message before you can see other posts. Click the 'Start a New Conversation' button to respond to this topic.""

The optimal solution would be to provide the ""Start a New Conversation"" button near the warning to make it more intuitive.  This would be similar to the changes in the Gradebook when there are no gradebook items and the empty state offers the ""Add Gradebook Item.""

I think that this could be a low-cost highly useful addition to Sakai.

 

Additional info of Michael Green:

I assume we'd want to do this either as a CKEditor5 Plugin [https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/overview.html] or by treating it as a LTI Content Item link and adding to the Add Learning App options. Is using LTI Content Item even an option for this kind of thing @anyone?
  
 We did some integration work around MS Teams and creating a team/managing team members, but I think that was all using the MS APIs and custom development on our Kits platform. I'd have to check with that developer on their bandwidth as they work on another team, but if someone wants to dig into this, I'd be happy to connect you with them to discuss what they learned about interacting with MS Teams.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SAK-41605,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,,,,"0|10c8ps:",9223372036854775807,,,,,Not started,,,,,,,"06-Aug-2020 03:25;daniel.merino;Becky Roehrs points that, if finally this feature is included in CK Editor, should be incorporated in an existing Jira for Features, Plugins and Configurations for CKEditor.","26-Aug-2020 02:21;daniel.merino;One Moodle partner developed an integration of the Teams plugin for their editor.

An instructor in a course site containing 130+ students regularly utilizes the Tests & Quizzes tool to assess students. The instructor often allows for multiple submission attempts and records the highest score achieved. 

In the “Export” tab, the instructor would like to export assessment responses, but only export the responses for the highest score achieved – not for all submissions (current functionality).

For example, assume two students – Student A and Student B – submitted 3 times and 5 times, respectively. Current functionality only allows an export of all submissions: 8 rows of data would be exported.

Now, if the instructor were given an option to export only the “highest score” responses, then the export would only include 2 rows of data – the assessment responses tied to the highest score achieved by Student A and Student B.

By extension, if the instructor configures the assessment to record the “last score,” then the export feature would function in a similar way.

I have included a quick mock-up of what this could look like below.

Please note the following. In this vision of the feature request:
 * “All Submissions” would be the default drop-down option on the “Export” page.
 * Based upon what the instructor set for “If multiple submissions, record the …” (in Settings > Grading and Feedback page), the appropriate option would populate in the drop-down envisioned on the “Export” tab (see mock-ups below).

If recorded score is *last score*, drop-down shows *All Submissions* and *Last Submission* options:

!Last Submission Export.png!

If recorded score is *highest score*, drop-down shows *All Submissions* and *Highest Submission* options:

I see that it's still awaiting review. Thanks!","17-Jul-2020 07:40;rainribbon;Just a guess: maybe it's waiting for you to define what should happen when *Average Score* is the grading model for multiple submissions?

When you export file upload submissions for an *Average Score* test, you get the items from the *last submission*.  I assume if Average Score were the scoring model here, your default would give you *All Submissions* (where the ""recorded score"" column shows the average of those scores) and the other option would be *Last Submission*.  However, some text may be needed on the page to explain (maybe after the sentence ""click Export..."") when a user has Average Score enabled so it's clear why the last submission is the option there.","08-Dec-2020 11:57;rainribbon;[~jbuckin2] in updating the testing steps, I took a look at the scores display in Samigo when *average score* recording is enabled.  There is no option to change the drop-down on the *Questions*, *Statistics*, or *Item Analysis* tabs from *All submissions*.  I think the export page should mirror this behavior and simply be locked into *All Submissions* (with drop-down disabled) when *average score* is recorded.","08-Dec-2020 12:02;jbuckin2;[~rainribbon], Thank you! I think that makes sense then, to keep it consistent with other behavior. 

I appreciate your input!","08-Dec-2020 12:25;rainribbon;[~jbuckin2] I updated testing steps.  You'll need to review them and confirm expected behavior for both anonymous release assessments and anonymous grading for the regression tests at the end.

IMO, the behavior of drop-downs and resulting export data should be consistent with results from *Total Scores*, *Questions*, *Statistics* and *Item Analysis* tabs, all of which have view options for their menus.  Note also that a second drop-down appears on *Total Scores* and *Questions* for specifying the *Entire Site* vs. group/roster for which to view submissions (assuming anonymous submissions or grading are NOT enabled).  The behavior of the desired menus on the export page should match this as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The new feature consists of two parts: assignment peer-review and assignment self-report; in both cases using rubrics.

On the one hand, the self-report with rubric, to enable the student to self-evaluate with rubric when submitting their homework; and, on the other, the peer-review, to make rubric peer review possible between students; in other words, the student evaluates the work, “assignments” of other students with a rubric.

These functions will be enabled and disabled by the teacher when editing the assignment.

One important point about this new feature is that, at the moment, it has not been supported by “New Grader”.

Test Plan:

1.- Self-Report

-Go to Assignments as instructor

-Add new assignment -Check ""Use the following rubric to grade this assignment""

-Select a rubric

-Check ""Allow students to self-report their work""

-Fullfill the rest of parameter of the assignment and click ""save""

-Go to the Assignment as Students

-Do the assignment

-In the view you can see the rubric to self report

-Click ""save"" or ""submit"" after fullfill the rubric, otherwise you can't click the buttons.

-As instructor again, go to Assignment, and Grade, ant then Grading Rubric tab.

-You can see and validate or overwrite the student self-report rubric.

 

2.-Peer-Review

-As instructor set the peer-review in the assignment (Open Date, Due Date, etc).

-Do two assignments as two different students.

-When the peer-review period begins the sutdents can access to the assignment and they will find a link to the peer review

-Later, after the period of peer-review finish, as instructor, you can see these reviews and validate and make feedback

Unfortunately this issue did not get 'picked up' yet. I'll try to clarify the importance from educational point of view (I have also attached two screenshots for better understanding).

The ultimate goal of the Rubric tool is to provide for better, objective grading possibilities that provide students with far better insight on a criterion by criterion level how their learning curve has been and where knowledge gaps are still existing.

Peer Assessment carries a lot of potential, increasing student engagement, increasing critical thinking skills, increasing reflection skills, increasing providing and receiving feedback skills and many, many more. One thing which is of utter importance with peer assessment is to give guidance in how to assess, by providing Rubrics.

Currently the Rubric can be linked to the Assignment grading (by the Faculty), however not to the peer assessment grading (by Students). Making this functionality happen for peer assessment assignments, would elevate both the Assignment and Rubrics tool value to a far higher level.

See screenshots enclosed.

I truly hope this request will gain support from the community... I can't imagine we're the only institution with this need?

Counting on support...

Tonco

 

!Peer Review 01.JPG!","17-Dec-2019 08:50;sfoster9;[~bergarvi] or [~toncotijdeman]: can one of you please steps to the Test Plan section for a tester to verify how this will work? Thanks.","17-Dec-2019 11:30;ern;One of the design issue's around this will be how to link these to the Rubric, any solution should contain a well thought out approach and the model needs to reflect that.

The current rubrics model doesn't allow for this type of linking in an elegant way.","05-Jun-2020 11:40;ern;Rubrics was never released by the community in the 12.x assuming this is either a mistake or they're on a custom 12.x branch.","05-Jun-2020 11:58;ern;Before development begins I would first socialize the implementation as rubrics doesn't support this currently.

Key concepts are that rubrics are meant to evaluate a unit of work i.e. an assignment submission, it was never meant to evaluate intangibles as this is a  contentious concept.

For example a key question to ask might be:
 # If I am not evaluating a submission (tangible) but a peer what data needs to be collected to support such a rating?
 # Careful of a ""Partcipation"" rating, because all too often a participation grade does not reflect participation, but rather personal bias.","06-Jun-2020 16:46;cschwiebert;[~ern], I can't vouch for other institutions, but for us, peer assessment is used for evaluating a submission. This feature is very popular with the Composition classes - students review their classmate's paper and give feedback prior to the final draft being submitted for the instructor to grade. Currently, our instructors use the peer assessment instructions to provide a psudo-rubric for reviewers.  Being able to have the students review their peers with a copy of the rubric that the instructor would be using for grading or a similar, simplified rubric, could help students revise their paper before the final draft.

Even if the peer assessment was used for intangibles, the very nature of a rubric helps make it more defined. Let the instructor create the rubric, link it to the peer assessment activity, and the reviewers/graders can see the standards that they should be scoring on, which would help ensure that the various grading criteria are given more consistent consideration and weight across the class.","08-Jun-2020 00:52;bergarvi;Yes, sorry Earle, I remembered the 12.x was a custom backport, so the contribution will be directly to 21.

As Christina says, peer review is used for evaluating submissions and it's been a highly requested feature for a long time (like Tonco can attest too).

{noformat}
(Evaluator n...) <-> submission{noformat}","18-Nov-2020 06:59;mrutea;Hi, everyone;

We have been working on a new two options within the ""Assignment"" tool.

As the notes of this tickets say above, {color:#172b4d}it is {color}{color:#172b4d}a new feature that has been sponsored by UPV (Universitat Politècnica de València).{color}

The new feature consists of two parts: assignment peer-review with rubrics and assignment self-report with rubrics.

On the one hand, the self-report, to enable the student to self-evaluate when submitting their homework; and, on the other, the peer-review, to make peer review possible between students; in other words, the student evaluates the work, “assignments” of other students.

These functions will be enabled and disabled by the teacher when editing the assignment.

One important point about this new feature is that, at the moment, it has not been supported by “New Grader”.

 

First the self-report.

The teacher can mark in “Assignment” / “Edit” the possibility of allowing self-report to a student.

 

!image-2020-11-18-13-59-46-146.png!","18-Nov-2020 07:01;mrutea;For such self-report, the rubric chosen on screen will be used.

{color:#333435}One important point of this new feature is that when the check “Use the following rubric to grade this assignment” is marked, the number of submission students must review is limited to one.{color}

The student will then be able to self-evaluate when performing the task.

!image-2020-11-18-14-00-27-878.png!

When you submit the assignment as student and you have to confirm it, you will also be able to see - not editable - your evaluation in the next view.

Later, if you want to edit it, you can press ""Edit"" and return to the view of your ""assignment"" and maybe modify it.

An interesting point is that self-evaluation is mandatory, in that case, until the student does his ""self-report"" he does not have enabled the buttons to submit the work.

 

Then the teachers can see the self-report of the student when they access the ""grader"" and see the student's self-assessment and add the evaluation.

 

!image-2020-11-18-14-01-01-161.png!

 ","18-Nov-2020 07:03;mrutea;Regarding the peer-review, students will be able to evaluate the “assigments” of other students.

When the completion date for the task has arrived, the peer-review phase opens.

While it is time to finish the peer-reviews of ""assignments"" the students will be able to do the review.

But as we said earlier, the student only can do 1 peer-review. The number is limited to 1.

!image-2020-11-18-14-02-06-197.png!

And the professor can validate, or overwrite, this peer-review in the grader.

!image-2020-11-18-14-02-35-130.png!

 

Finally, the modules affected by the changes are: Assignment, Rubrics and Webcomponents.

And the target of this feature is Sakai 22.x.

 

Thank you.

PURPOSE

As an instructor, I can leave comments on individual items but I cannot leave an overall comment about the student's cumulative experience or performance. I am requesting an option to add a comment to accompany the final Course Grade for a student.
h1. REQUEST

Add a new feature to the instructor's Gradebook to add/edit a comment for the overall course grade. Any comment added would display on the individual student's gradebook view.

Ideally, it would be available as a drop-down for the Course Grade (similar to ""add/edit comment"" for any gradebook item).  The comment would appear at the top of the student's Gradebook view, below the overall Course Grade.  It would only appear if a comment was added (if an instructor doesn't leave a comment, only the existing ""Course Grade"" line would display; don't leave extra, empty space or list a generic item like ""No comment made"" since that adds no value for either the student or the instructor; the comment should be purely optional).

This option would allow me to thank students on the official grade page for their participation or growth during a term, offer suggestions for continued learning or growth, or leave any other performance-related note that may clarify the grade or summarize the experience.

Thank you for considering this feature request.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"18-Nov-2020 14:09;rainribbon;coursegradecomments-mockup2.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/57399/coursegradecomments-mockup2.png","14-Jan-2020 11:44;alanregan;gradebookng-student-report-comment.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/54749/gradebookng-student-report-comment.png",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,,,,"0|10c1dc:",9223372036854775807,,Please add a Test Plan here.,,,Not started,,,,,,,"14-Jan-2020 13:32;alanregan;Created a very rough, quick mockup of what the basic ""overall' grade comment might look like.

Again, just a rough draft of what a summative comment or individual student's course feedback feature might look like. 

Big picture, I still feel that the student view of the Gradebook needs a facelift to make it more modern and engaging. The following FARM proposal is over 2 years old (and the design could be improved) but that separate feature request is here for reference: https://jira.sakaiproject.org/browse/FARM-7  ","15-Jan-2020 09:33;psg3a@virginia.edu;T&L comments (1/15/20):

 !coursegradecomments-mockup2.png|thumbnail! 

One other suggestion: it might be nice to have an additional checkbox in the ""Grade Release Rules"" section of the *Settings* page, to choose whether or not to display course grade comments to students.  I could see an instructor wanting to work on comments over time and release them at a later date.  Alternatively, an instructor might want to release comments without releasing the course grade because the grades aren't finalized yet.

This doesn't make sense for users, since they expect to find tools in alphabetical order in the main list. The collapsible list can be expanded through the use of a property (see SAK-30371), but then the UI presents two separate alphabetical lists to users -- and generally, users don't care about the distinction between native tools and external tools.

Also, some LTI tools (e.g. [Hypothes.is|https://web.hypothes.is/]) do not work as ""sidebar tools"" but instead work from within Lessons. It's difficult for users to know which tools in the External Tools list are ""sidebar tools"" or ""Lessons tools"" without an administrator providing appropriate textual descriptions for each tool.

At our institution we've been registering LTI tools that work as ""sidebar tools"" using IMSBLTIportlet.xml in order to have them appear in the list of ""native Sakai tools""; this makes the user experience better, since they have a single list of sidebar tools to choose from. Tools which only work in Lessons are NOT defined in IMSBLTIportlet.xml so that they only appear in External Tools.

Samigo: Set a point value at the Part level instead of the question level,SAK-44525,88728,New Feature,OPEN,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project.

Basic concept
A frequent point of frustration for instructors is that they must assign point values in a quiz to individual questions.  Many instructors just want to be able to assign a set of points to the assessment overall, or to groups of questions.  This feature request is to provide a box for assigning a total point value at the part level, whether the part is with ""questions authored one-by-one"" or ""random draw from question pool"", instead of assigning points to each question.

*Notes:*
* Most instructors requesting this feature just want to simplify their workflow.
* While I am aware that instructors can use Random Draw to automatically assign the same point value to each question, the option does not cover the use cases described below.

h2. Example use cases for this feature:

h3. Primary use cases:
# Instructor wants all questions in the assessment to have equal point value, regardless of whether each question will have a repeating decimal value of points.  Currently, they have to enter long decimal point values and hope the rounding works out as desired in both Tests & Quizzes and the Gradebook.
# Instructor needs all assessments to have the exact same point value, regardless of the total number of questions per assessment, because they want to drop the lowest quiz grade in Gradebook.
# Instructor wants all questions in the assessment to have equal point value, but they want the questions to appear in a specific order in the assessment, not in a random order.

h3. Editing post-submission use cases:
# Instructor needs to ""drop"" a confusing or badly worded question from a quiz and set its point value to 0, while automatically redistributing points equally to other questions.
# Instructor needs to drop the lowest quiz score in the Gradebook, and needs all quizzes to have the same point value, but didn't realize that when they initially created the quizzes.  They want to edit a specific quiz and re-distribute the remaining points equally to other questions.

h2. Suggested display/edit UI for options:

h3. Edit Part UI
Where you specify how you want the part to be formatted and laid out, there would be two new options (preliminary concept labels below need to be reworded to be clear and simple, and clearly differentiated from setting point value for questions with Random Draw):

How should points be assigned to questions in this part?
* Assign points to questions individually (default setting, current functionality)
* Assign points to the part with point value distributed equally among questions

h3. Questions editing page

Depending on the instructor's selections for the point distribution, slightly different display functionality on the _Questions_ page would be needed.

If points assigned to questions individually:
* To the right of the part, disabled _Total points for part_ text box displays (i.e., sum of question point values in part). Explanatory text (or an accessible info bubble to explain why the field is disabled) is provided near this disabled field to indicate that you need to edit points for individual questions, or edit the part to change points per question to points per part.
* The _points_ text boxes for questions have current behavior (enter points and can update points at bottom of page).

If points assigned to the part:
* A _Total points for part_ text box appears to the right of the part to edit the point value for the part.  Upon editing the value in this box and clicking *Update Points* at the bottom of the page, points would automatically redistribute equally among questions in the part.
* The points per question (i.e., part point value divided by total questions in part) display in text box for each question's _points_, but the text box is disabled. Explanatory text (or an accessible info bubble to explain why the field is disabled) is provided near this disabled field to indicate that you need to edit points in the part.  Preferably, this explanatory text would include a direct link to skip to the _Total points for part_ box where you make the edits.

h2. Potential Caveats and Concerns

h3. Special Scoring

There are several special scoring options that could create complications for the proposed feature:
# Partial credit for multiple choice, single selection
# Correct minus Incorrect vs. All or Nothing scoring for multiple choice, multiple selection
# Minimum point value
# Negative marking
 
h4. Related Questions:
* If equal point distribution among questions is used, do we allow for blanket-enabling of all these options across questions in the part (except for multiple choice, partial credit)?
** Where would we place such blanket edit options - part information only, on Questions screen (see also SAK-41297)?
** If there are different kinds of questions in the part, how do we allow for specifying the scoring setting for those? For example, assume there are several multiple choice, multiple correct questions, and the instructor wants all to have Correct minus Incorrect scoring.  But there are also several other types of questions, e.g., multiple choice, single correct and true false - where do we surface the option for setting the multiple choice, multiple correct scoring?
* In all cases where disabling options is required, what would the indications look like, and how would they direct the user to change their settings if desired?  Examples:
** Suggest that the instructor create a new part and move a specific multiple choice question into it for partial credit.
** Present a link on the page they're currently on to update the values for the part, and send them off to that link - if this is done, the navigation action would also have to save the question presently being edited.",https://experimental.nightly.sakaiproject.org/portal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SAK-41297,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,,,,"0|10cbkg:",9223372036854775807,,"Test plan will require many steps and significant regression testing for scoring every question type, with combinations of special scoring settings per question (partial credit, minimum point value, negative marking).

That way, if a retake is allowed, both the original and retake version are shown without extra effort on the instructor's behalf.

I personally lean towards having a separate tab, rather than merging it with the Item Order view.

Putting it on *Item Order* is confusing. In the proof-of-concept shown by [~ottenhoff], it isn't clear that the numbers are points for the items.

This same table could be added on a separate page instead of a modal if needed.

We all seemed to agree that we preferred to have this feature to be on its own tab/page rather than having it as a modal window because of how large and complicated some Gradebooks become and that would be a lot of items to display in a modal.

Here's a diff from when we first did moved this feature to Sakai 12. Not sure if this is helpful, but it's a little tough for us to grant access to our repo directly. 
 [^gradebook_items.diff] ","27-Feb-2020 11:00;alanregan;First, I want to echo my appreciation for this feature request and all of the effort and thought that has gone into it thus far.

For the ""edit"" functionality mentioned in the ticket description, I am curious...
 * Would the actual items be active (e.g. checkbox for release, checkbox for include in calculations, move buttons to change order or category, etc.) and a Save button on the page to quickly save the changes for multiple items on the single page?
 * Else, with the functionality mentioned in the ticket description, the edit link should be very obvious to instructors (e.g. in addition to the name of the item underlined as an active hyperlink, also add to the immediate right the traditional paper/pencil edit icon to make it very clear that the link allows edits – plus appropriate titles for screen readers, icon and name are selectable, etc.)?

The mantra we hear from our professors is: ""Save us clicks!""  This is a great feature request, so I just want to see what would feel intuitive and efficient from an instructor's point of view.  Thanks!","27-Feb-2020 11:01;davidpbauer;[~a.fish@lancaster.ac.uk] I saw you assigned this to yourself, but I'm not sure if that means you are about to work on it.

If so, I'd like to caution against using our contribution. We re-evaluated this feature as part of our 20.x upgrade and determined that it repeated functionality that works a lot better in its original context. Specifically, we took the ""new"" functionality (quickly deleting items, seeing how many students are graded for each item, seeing the points breakdown) and integrated it into two new features.
# Quickly deleting items is now part of bulk edit. This work was shared in SAK-43061
# Seeing the items breakdown and how many students have been graded so far was moved to a new modal called ""Course Breakdown"" that is available in the dropdown header for the course grade column.

I'm happy to discuss this more and share our course grade breakdown feature if there is interest.","27-Feb-2020 12:00;cschwiebert;[~alanregan], when I was talking with Adrian and Earle about this earlier, I had suggested that the item name / edit icon open the Edit Item Details window for that item. That way, for items that are created by other tools (Assignments, Tests & Quizzes), the instructor will see the message to go to <tool> to edit the title, points, and due date. 

I think if we tried to make this a bulk edit page we would have to either limit it to only the settings that can be modified for all items, regardless of origin (category, released, included in course grade) or have all fields editable and risk confusion as this item can't change the points or name, but that one can.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This separating of tickets by tool (in my opinion) is a huge contributor to the fact that there is not enough consistency between tools. It confounds users and support staff alike that learning to do something in one tools is different than another tool.
 * The buttons look different,
 * they are labeled different, (Overview ""Update Options"" vs Lessons ""Save)
 * they are sometimes at the top and sometimes at the bottom of the page. (Sites and Site info, vs. Everything else)
 * tools allow you do reorder things in different ways (Forums vs. Tool Order)
 * The syllabus tool manages sections different from the Lessons tools which is different from the Overview tool
 * etc...

This is a huge factor in why users don't know how to use Sakai well. Every tool is a new learning experience. Is there a team looking at Sakai holistically? If not, can there be? Can I be on it? Deliberately making tools more similar would go a long way to helping users and user support staff.","14-Oct-2020 10:56;alanregan;Hi, Bonnie.  [~sfoster9] and the Sakai User Experience group would be a good place to start.  That team has been working with Duke University on significant user interface improvements across the board.  Many of Duke's suggestions are in the Sakai 21 or 22 versions.

The problem arises when an instructor attaches a file to an Announcement (or Schedule item or Forum or Assignment, I believe) that she later wants to remove.  She can remove the Announcement (or Schedule item or Forum post or Assignment), but any student who received email notification and therefore has the attachment link can still access the file.

So, a false positive when the Instructor believes she has deleted the Assignment.  

This false positive becomes a real risk when the instructor has accidentally attached a file with private or protected information.

","21-Oct-2011 11:42;bkirschn;Note that having an admin user in a production environment look for the attachment in Resources results in a significant performance degradation -- ideally this should be prevented.","05-Jan-2012 11:36;jonespm;Comment from Jim Eng, just capturing it for reference: 

That probably duplicates several dozen earlier JIRA tickets on the subject.  It may be easier to do now than it would have been at earlier times, based on work Chuck Severance did a few years ago to make it possible to attach site permissions to attachments. At one time attachment id's consisted of two random guid's, but we changed that to use the site-id as part of the resource-id.  I think that was done to make it possible that an admin could construct a URL to find a specific attachment through the UI (though still not possible in a sakai instance on Michigan's scale).

I think those changes made attachments for a site discoverable by users who wouldn't ordinarily have permission to view the item containing the attachment.  So I think at that point, access views of those folders were restricted.  But based on that work, it might be relatively easy to create a view of the attachments folder for a site.  So again, my point here is that this has been requested many times in the past and it might be more feasible now.  

But it may still not be real feasible.  For one thing, the attachments for a site are relatively unstructured. If I recall, the id's are by site and then by tool, but from there, the names use guid's, and the display names may be meaningless.  Plus, the folder may contain thousands of attachments in a large site, and if a site maintainer navigates into such a folder and starts moving things into folders, the attachments will be broken.  

I guess my point here is that it is not a simple problem.  If you actually wanted to let site maintainers have access to attachments (assuming that is feasible), you would need a design that avoided breaking everything because someone didn't read a stupid warning message.  

Just my opinion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common request here is to indicate only the questions that a student got wrong, show the selection that they made, but don't mark the correct answer so that the student can try the assessment again.

I wonder if there would be three main radio button options:
 * Only Release Student's Assessment Scores (questions not shown)
 * Show all questions and the following:
 * Show only incorrect questions and the following:

When one of the bottom two radio options (all questions or only incorrect) are selected, then the option expands with the selection checkboxes.

For ""Show all questions and the following"" refer to SAK-40527 for possible re-wording or categorization of selection options.

For ""Show only incorrect questions and the following"" perhaps offer the same selection options as above plus the option to only show the question with an incorrect indicator (red X) and no answers at all?  I can see several possible use-cases, like self-paced quizzes where a professor only wants students to see the questions that they got wrong (but not give away the answer so that they can take the assessment again).  In other use-cases, like one-attempt quizzes, show just the items missed with various feedback so they can learn from the mistakes...

From a teaching perspective, professors may offer multiple attempts on an assessment, especially a low-stakes, reinforcement activity.  By showing that they got a specific answer wrong (but not telling them the correct answer), then they can try again.  Ideally, the students would reflect, re-read materials, or re-read the questions they missed more carefully to reach the correct answer on their own.

I'd like to make it shorter, but not sure how to make it clear to users?  We frequently get questions about what the option ""question and part scores"" means, and that one I think is pretty self-explanatory.

This is an outstanding feature to check for student understanding after a video or some other content. 

Once students submit an answer to the question(s), the instructor has access to view how the students responded. We believe that the student response table could use some improvements for instructor understanding and review.

List of Challenges:
 # First, the ""Student Name"" column is intended to show which student submitted which response. However, in cases where two (or more) students might have the exact same name (i.e. ""John Smith""), this can become difficult to distinguish which one answered and which didn't. 
 # Second, there is no way to distinguish on this table between students who might be in different course sections.
 # Third, there is no timestamp indicating when a student answered the question. In scenarios/cases where accountability becomes important, it can be incredibly useful for instructors to have access to a timestamp for when the student submitted an answer for the question.
 # Lastly, the table seems to be malformed in that it has an empty column by default. 

I have attached 4 screenshots to this proposal.
 # ""Question.png"" shows an example question on a Lessons sub-page.
 # ""Question - Student Responses - Current State.png"" shows the current state of the Student Responses table.
 # ""Question - Student Responses - Not Graded - Desired State.png"" shows a ""vision"" for implementing these changes on NON-Graded questions.
 # ""Question - Student Responses - Graded - Desired State.png"" shows a ""vision"" for implementing these changes on Graded questions.

Ultimately, the vision is to incorporate additional columns to assist the instructor. The envisioned table incorporates the following columns (in the following order) for *NON-Graded* questions:
 # Student Name
 # ID
 # Response
 # Submit Date
 # Enrolled in (i.e. Section)

For *Graded* questions:
 # Student Name

 # Grade

I'd prefer to see a _View_ drop-down menu above the table like the ones in _Gradebook_, _Assignments_, and _Tests & Quizzes_ where you can filter participants by group to just view/grade answers from members of that group.

 ","23-Jul-2019 09:55;davidpbauer;Mobile view of tabs
 !Selection_433.png|thumbnail! ","23-Jul-2019 12:10;alanregan;First, thank you for proposing improvements. It's always easier to criticize than create – so thank you for all of the efforts to make Sakai a better platform for teaching and learning.

I like the simplicity of the design. The settings in Tests & Quizzes can be overwhelming, and breaking them into tabs that reduce scrolling seems helpful.

The arrow icons in the tabs are confusing to me. I don't see that standard elsewhere in the system (or I can't recall it; I also can't think of other software applications where that iconography is used in tabs but I may just be unfamiliar). I feel like I understand the intent of the icons but my gut says that those decorative items should be dropped. (Sorry!) Tabbed settings are common in different applications, so my perspective is that the interface invites people to explore the different options. If the community feels strongly that a sequence is important to convey, then simply add a number in front of each tab label (e.g. 1. About, 2. Availability and Submissions, etc.)? I don't advocate for adding the numbers – I don't think they are necessary – but it is an option if sequencing is deemed important by the community. In case someone suggests it, I would argue against adding ""Next""/""Previous"" buttons at the bottom of each tabbed page since the tab layout suggests a sequence naturally; I don't want button bloat. So, I would vote for the arrow icons to be dropped if the tabbed approach is adopted.

Sam raises a good point about saving; I assume that all of the selections would naturally be saved for the session as the user progresses in the tabbed form but only permanently saved once an appropriate button is clicked to finalize the action. I also see the point about expanding all and searching for a specific setting via the browser's built-in ""Find"" functionality – that does become an issue in a tabbed layout. However, I do like the reduction of scrolling with tabs, as I mentioned earlier. Pros/cons here.

Sam's point about expand/collapse brings up mobile-friendliness. Thinking mobile, I do happen to prefer the accordions as a more natural interface on a phone or tablet. I don't author any tests on a mobile device, personally, but that's something to consider. (Side note: If accordions are kept, I would prefer for the accordions to look more like buttons in a mobile view and all be collapsed so I can see all of the available ""buttons"" on the screen. I know why the second accordion is defaulted to ""open"" for computer screens, but on a mobile device, I feel like seeing all of the items as buttons on a single screen is important for usability and gives someone the option of opening another option immediately if desired. Just an opinion!)

A question that instantly popped up for me when looking at the proposed tab layout was: why is ""Publish"" separated from the bottom buttons of ""Save and Exit"" and ""Cancel""? These are terminal or closing actions and the separation of these items creates dissonance for me, personally. I think I understand the intent to place the ""Publish"" settings in the same interface so users can make selections on the screen and have a bit more help content on the page, but then an additional ""Save Settings and Publish"" button exists on that tab... creating potential visual confusion. The on-screen text is good, but we often hear feedback that the interface should make sense from looking at it (without having to read directions). They would see two save buttons on the screen, kind of stacked.  As someone who knows the difference between the buttons, I worry that someone new to Tests & Quizzes might feel that the design is a bit ""clunky.""

A bigger question about the ""Publish"" tab... is its sole purpose to have a button?  If there are no settings on the page, then I question whether the text is enough reason for the tab to exist. A possible option would be to add the ""notification"" setting to this page (the selection to send or not send a notification to site members about the assessment's publication). In fact, with the screen real estate, it opens the possibility of rich text content for the notification which would potentially add value. Granted, separating that functionality might require changing the functionality of the ""publish"" final confirmation screen – if initiated from the Settings screen, then present the direct link and the 3 buttons to publish, edit, or cancel; if initiated from the ""edit assessment"" page or the main Tests & Quizzes screen, then display the light-weight notification option and text box along with the link and 3 buttons... Or simply cut the ""Publish"" tab altogether. Afterall, it would add an extra click – someone would have to click the ""Publish"" tab just the see the ""Save and Publish"" button, right? Ideally, we should reduce the number of clicks whenever possible.

I know not everyone likes modal windows, but I kind of wonder whether the 3 buttons (Save and Publish, Save and Exit, Cancel) should be consistently located at the bottom, and when ""Save and Publish"" is clicked, a modal window is presented with the ""publish"" options related to notifications, confirmation of select settings, direct link, etc., and the final action buttons of ""Publish,"" ""Edit Settings,"" and ""Cancel"" on that screen? ""Cancel"" would close the settings altogether and return to the edit screen of the assessment or the main Tests & Quizzes screen depending on the initiating location. ""Edit Settings"" would close the modal window and return to the tabs. ""Publish"" would finish the process, publishing the assessment with the selected options and settings. This feels like a more natural workflow for me, but just my initial responses to the proposed design. Of course, any accessibility concerns would need to be addressed.

Overall, I think the option of tabs is a good possibility and worth exploring. It feels like it benefits computer-based users more than mobile users, though; I encourage thought about improving the mobile experience and making it flow naturally in a button-based, small-screen environment. As a mostly computer-based user, though, reducing scrolling via the tabs is a big win for me. I do feel some additional adjustments will be important to streamline the process and make it as logical and easy as possible. No matter the outcome, I think this will spark some good ideas about user interface design and usability.

My $0.02. Sorry for the novel.","23-Jul-2019 13:38;rainribbon;[~ottenhoff] and [~alanregan] both bring up excellent points.

On the one hand, I agree that *Expand All* is a valuable option for the current state of the page, and especially helpful for the veteran user who just wants to edit a single setting quickly.

On the other hand, I really like the more ""wizard-like"" approach this takes for users who are unfamiliar with the tool. 
 I think it does a great job of breaking up the sometimes overwhelming ""noise"" on the screen into distinct sections.  Personally, I find the arrows helpful for guiding a new user through the different steps as a process, but maybe the navigation should look slightly different than the tabs in Sakai, if it's going to be step-like. Maybe something similar to the convention of [~Piazza]'s Search pagination?

 !searchpagination.png|thumbnail! 

I agree with [~alanregan] that putting the *Save Settings and Publish* button on its own tab is confusing.  It would be better if that page took you to the confirmation screen where you can choose the calendar and notification settings.

That said, I believe a separate publication confirmation screen is needed because several checks need to be performed before publishing, including checking that the following are true:
* The available date is not before the due date,
* The due date is not before the late submission date, if late submissions are enabled,
* There's no gradebook item with a conflicting title, if grades are being sent to the Gradebook.

This goes outside the scope of the change mentioned in this jira, but if it's possible to perform those checks before displaying a modal window, I think the confirmation screen might be ok in a modal (it's just a couple check boxes, a plain text box, and a couple buttons).  As others have already mentioned, if considering moving the publication confirmation to a modal window, we would need to keep in mind the potential accessibility issues with modals and difficulty accessing them on mobile devices/small screens.

*tl;dr:* I like the design proposed here, except for the *Publish* tab. I think the *Save Settings & Publish* button should just show at the bottom of each page like the *Save* and *Cancel* buttons do.","24-Jul-2019 13:51;splatt@rwu.edu;+1  My brief comments is that I like the Tabs setup better versus the Accordion.  One thing I don't like right now in the accordion, when you click on the Settings it opens the second item ""Availability and Submissions"" and not the first item ""About this Assessment"".   In the first item, which includes the Honor Pledge, this gets missed because an instructor assumes the first opened item is the first one to view and update.  The Honor Pledge shouldn't be there to begin with but in """"Availability and Submissions"" section.  In the Tabs, at least they will open and review the first one if numbered or with arrows going left to right.  It would be nice to have Tabs but also have the capability of an expanded view too. I like everyone's ideas and comments that have been made before me.  Again, it's a change for the better for Sakai in my opinion. Nice concept David!","21-Aug-2019 11:17;sfoster9;We discussed this today in the Sakai UX group. 

We agree with other commenters above on some points such as:
- the icons should be removed from the tabs
- publish shouldn't be its own tab; rather, it should be a button at the bottom to ""Save and Publish"" to do the checks that Tiffany mentioned, maybe with a separate confirmation screen

It's worth noting that tabs have been a convention for complex settings pages in desktop applications, such as browsers or IDEs. However, we're unaware of examples of long settings pages in web applications for creating new items/assets/content, like a quiz is in Samigo. 

We have concerns about the consistency of using tabs for settings for other tools in Sakai, such as the Add/Edit page in Assignments. Will tabs work for other tools with simpler settings pages too?

We aren't 100% convinced that the proposed tabs view improves the experience over the current accordion display. We think more could still be done to improve over either option.  

[~jtingen] offered to conduct some user testing on the different options. 

We discussed the possibility of developing new convention for Sakai for our tools' pages, such as:
- having a bar fixed to the bottom of the screen on pages with action buttons, like ""Save"" or ""Save and Publish"" in the case of Samigo (could have ""Remove"" or ""Update"" on pages with tables containing checkmarks for each option, so buttons won't be needed at the top and bottom of the tables)
- having progressive release for complex options that would ask a question to enable a feature before showing the settings for that option, which would clean up the amount of setting appearing on the initial page and therefore reduce the cognitive load for users when they go to this page. The Add/Edit page in Assignment already uses this convention for the Content Review (e.g. Turnitin) section and for Peer Assessment. More has been added recently for the Assignments Grading section in SAK-42354.
- having better section design and structure on tools' settings pages by utilizing headings, bottom borders, wells, framesets, etc
- having a table of contents of the sections of these settings page (after we have better section design and structure) could achieve similar functionality to the tabs and accordion designs by providing an option to jump to a particular section while also allowing all settings to existing on a single page

We decided the Sakai community should do more brainstorming and UX testing to come up with better overall design for forms that could address the concerns above before making further changes. Therefore, we do not endorse making this change to tabs at this time.","04-Sep-2019 09:35;lgekeler;TLReview: We're so happy [~jtingen] volunteered to do user testing. Removing the collapsible, and changing to tabs would fit in with the way other tools are using them. We need a consistent UI layout, as well as making Samigo more usable. [~rainribbon] [~lcira] [~cebristow] were on the call, and like the mockup and agree with UIReviewed comments above.
""Save and Publish"" takes you to another page that allows you to choose notification options, to the calendar, send an email... Should that be a modal?
Tabs on Settings screen were compared to tabs on Samigo... these are not consistent.
","04-Sep-2019 09:46;rainribbon;Looking at this again during the T&L call, we discussed the concern for having tabs on this page when tabs are typically at the top of tool pages.

The Samigo _Scores_ screens utilize tabs, and I don't think the design proposed here would be inconsistent with this behavior.  Here's a screen shot of the _Total Scores_ screen:

!tabsinscores.png|thumbnail! 

My vote is to move forward with this jira, with the exception of removing the *Publish* tab and moving the *Save Settings and Publish* button to the bottom of the screen with the other *Save* and *Cancel* buttons.","10-Sep-2019 08:40;davidpbauer;I appreciate everyone's thoughtful discussion around this change. I've removed the icons on the tabs and the publish tab. The publish button is back to exactly where it was before this work.

Samigo: Instructor option to let students start a retake with their last attempt's answers included.,SAK-43614,87357,New Feature,OPEN,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project.

Issue description with example use case

An instructor creates a timed test, e.g., with a 2-hour time limit.  A student starts the test and works on it for a significant amount of the time allotted, e.g., 1 hour, then their internet cuts off.  The student can't get back online and the test is automatically saved and submitted by the timer before they can return to it.

The instructor can allow a retake, but then the student *has to start over* from scratch, with the full 2-hour time limit.  In most cases like these, the instructor just wants to let the student *finish what they started*.  In the example provided above, the instructor would want to:
# Set a date/time exception for that student to allot 1 hour for the ""continued"" test.
# Allow a retake wherein the student has all their answers from the initial submission already included, and can pick up where they left off, answering the remaining questions.

I know there are similar jiras out there (e.g., SAK-34754), but this issue has come up multiple times recently as many instructors and students are new to teaching online and using _Tests & Quizzes_.

h2. Proposed fix

(I'm sure the suggested wording can be improved.)

When you click *Allow Retake*, have a pop-up window with a confirmation to indicate that you want the student to be able to see their previous answers during the retake, e.g.:
{quote}The student will start this retake with their responses from their last attempt already entered.{quote} 

Also, have options in this window to specify the due date (or late submission date) and time limit for the retake.

*Important:* The wording and how the instructor selects these options must be *easy to understand* and *accessible*; for example, the *Allow Retake* option on the _Submission Status_ screen might need to be changed from a link to a button, with the checkbox to be selected before that button in the tab order.

h2. Additional notes

Samigo has an existing option *Allow students to update their latest submission* to present students with a new take prefilled with their previous answers (this is *not* a new submission - the option specifically backs their last submission out of being submitted!)  The option is available if the instructor selects *Edit* > *Regrade and Republish* for an assessment, but for the use case described here, it's an *extremely* poor substitute and a clunky workaround.

If you select the checkbox *Allow students to update their latest submission* when republishing a test, it *removes all student submissions*.  Then *all students* in the class *must* resubmit the test in order for their submission to count.

The other problem with the *Allow students to update their latest submission* option is that if there was a time limit on the original assessment, you *cannot* use the option in concert with any time limit at all.  You *must* remove the time limit altogether *before* enabling the option.  Otherwise, when a student tries to continue the test, it recognizes that the original timer thread already expired and immediately submits it without giving the student any opportunity to work on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SAK-34754,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,,,,"0|10c5tk:",9223372036854775807,,"*Note:* Additional regression testing will be needed.

During the conversations about cleaning up those language packs, [~ern] proposed creating a language hierarchy for each language (e.g. English) with a base language (e.g. en_US) and regional differences (e.g. en_UK). The regional differences wouldn't be duplicating the base language; it would only include the few key/value pairs for differences (e.g. ""favorite"" being ""favourite""). 

This feature request is to implement this change in Resource Loader to understand and look-up hierarchies for each main language that we have supported in Sakai. It would work like:
# look for the message string for user's or site's language (e.g. en_UK)
# if the message string doesn't exist in that regional language, then Resource Loader would identify what the base language is (e.g. en_US)
# look for the message string for the base language (e.g. en_US)
# if the message string doesn't exist in the base language, then Resource Loader would fallback to the server instance language like it does today

The primary change of this proposed change is to group language differences together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,,,,"0|10bn4g:",9223372036854775807,,Please add a Test Plan here.,,,Not started,,,,,,,"16-Sep-2020 07:19;dhorwitz;date English:

Often times, instructors delete the drafts, because they don't want to see them feature in the main Assessments tab (and because the published version already exists). Hence the utility of this feature.

However, instructors may not realize that these drafts are important when teaching the class next semester. And because *Site Info* > *Import from Site*: A) only imports DRAFTS (not published copies), and B) only imports drafts found within the ""Assessments"" tab, then instructors need to restore any/all drafts that are in the ""Trash"" prior to doing the import from site process.

It would be helpful if there was some ""Select All"" to restore functionality to make this easier, especially if there are many, many drafts to restore. My thinking is that it would just be a simple checkbox in the header column of ""Select Assessments."" Thus, it would work just like the ""Select All"" checkbox within the ""Remove"" column in Site Info > Manage Participants. 

I've included a quick mock-up of what this feature could look like.

We use the property as a site property instead of a sakai.property because typically we want the default behaviour for most sites except for a few cases, like the one described below. (Although, I just noticed in SAK-19953 that it can be set in sakai.properties as well.)

We apply it only to certain sites that have specific requirements to need it: mainly for quiz scores that are used for criteria of a certificate in the Certification tool. If that certificate needs to be renewed and the tester gets the same quiz score on their next attempt, we need this property so the certificate renewal date is updated (which comes from the Gradebook update date). We add this property to site using the admin Sites tool. 

I think most of the time, this property is unnecessary and could lead to additional database updates. ","14-Sep-2020 15:15;austinUH;Thanks [~sfoster9],

"New Feature - Gradebook - Add a ""Penalty"" option for Gradebook items",SAK-31582,69140,New Feature,Awaiting Review,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project.

Allow instructors to add a Gradebook item to record negative values (penalties) into the Gradebook.  Imagine an inverse to the ""extra credit"" option.

USE CASE
Professor requests an option within the Gradebook to clearly indicate a penalty toward the overall student grade.  Specifically, the professor's grading scheme penalizes students for excessive absences.  The professor does not award points for attendance or participation.  For this professor, his approach is that participation is expected and critical for the collective growth of the cohort of mature learners; one cannot contribute to discussions and group learning if excessively absent.  The professor allows up to two absences per term, regardless of reason; each absence after that has a 5 point penalty on the overall course grade.

Currently, the professor must deduct points from another gradebook item, like the final exam, which can create confusion for the students.  The professor wants a very clear gradebook item (e.g. ""Absences"") that displays a negative point value to the student and deducts the value from the overall course grade (e.g. -5 or -10).

In attached screenshot, I mocked up a possible design for the feature.  When creating a gradebook item, radio button options can either select a standard gradebook item (the default option; this is the normal gradebook item that does not allow negative values and the point total for the item is included in the overall points possible for the course grade), an extra credit item (currently the checkbox item today, which doesn't allow negative values and the points possible is not included in the overall points possible for the course grade; the points assigned are included in the calculation to boost the grade), and finally the penalty item (an inverse of the extra credit, that allows entry of negative values (e.g. -5) and the points possible doesn't impact the total points possible for the course grade; values entered will deduct from the student's overall points earned).

To simplify data entry, perhaps add conditional logic for any value (whether entered as -5 or 5) to be saved as negative value (-5), and normal validation for no more than the allowable decimal range, allowing both periods and commas for the decimal value (internationalization), etc.

Thank you for considering this feature request for the Gradebook.

Or is just allowing entry of negative numbers sufficient?

 ","06-May-2019 12:11;alanregan;Technically, no, [~cebristow]. Allowing a negative number would make it possible to accomplish the goal. However, I would argue on the side of making the solution as intuitive and easy as possible for instructors. Having a clear label that defines the intent or purpose can be helpful to that end from my perspective.

The other side is that the ""total point value"" for a penalty item should not impact the total points possible. The number assigned should be subtracted only (like reverse extra credit).

The easiest solution (from a development standpoint) would be to allow negative values for ""extra credit"" items and change the label from ""Extra credit item"" to ""Extra credit or penalty item.""

The more robust solution (just my opinion!) would be a new item type with a clear label for the intent.  It would also allow the system to use data validation and warning messages specific to the item type/purpose. I could see value in a warning about a negative number in ""extra credit"" or a positive number in ""penalty,"" as examples. If we used one item type for both, then I am not sure what data validation could be employed other than multiple decimal markers, spaces, or letters.

But any solution that helps professors assess students based on their grading structure would be helpful.  In the distant past (Sakai 2.8?), I recall that negative marking was possible in what is now called Gradebook Classic. That workaround let instructors accomplish several of their goals back in the day. The loophole was closed at some point, though. Plus, the notion of a secret workaround isn't appealing to me. For example, while it can be fun to learn about the secret ""In-and-Out Burger"" menu options, I'm not a fan of that approach when it comes to features in the Gradebook. My $0.02!

NOTE: In-and-Out is a hamburger chain that started in California. It has branched out to a few extra states, but not the entire country. The posted menu in the restaurant is minimal by nature, but there are special ways you can ask for a burger to be prepared. Thus, the ""secret menu.""","27-Jul-2020 16:45;rainribbon;Hmm, it seems to me that this should behave like the ""Adjustment"" column in Tests & Quizzes, where you can either increase or decrease (with negative values) the score, but I'm really not sure how it should be implemented for Gradebook.

I think a ""Penalty"" item or category would be very confusing for grade entry - do I put a positive number in the boxes there (to mark *off* that number of points), or do I put a negative number (to adjust the grade with negative points)?

I also wouldn't want to bundle it together with ""extra credit"" as a single item type, because instructors already have trouble understanding how extra credit is calculated and should be used.

My main concern is that this isn't a very popular use case and more likely to confuse a majority of instructors.  If it's developed, it should be possible to disable at the system level with a property, and enable on a per-site basis for instructors who request that specific functionality.

One other potential issue is with spreadsheet export/import - how would the spreadsheet look on export, when such an item is included?  It would need to be intuitive in the spreadsheet export which items/sets of items (in the case of an entire penalty category) are causing point deductions, and possible to create/update such items on uploading a spreadsheet for import.

[~alanregan] for the time being, would it work for the instructor to add a category worth the maximum percentage that would be deducted from the student's course grade if excessive absences occur?  Create a single item in that category, and populate all cells (using the ""enter number in empty cells"" feature) with full credit at the start of the semester.  As the semester progresses, if absences greater than two accrue, deduct points from the affected student's grade in that item.","28-Jul-2020 15:48;alanregan;Hi, [~rainribbon]. Always grateful for your feedback! You bring up many great points.

 
h1. SYSTEM PROPERTY

I agree that a system property should be available for an institution to enable or disable this approach, if desired.  I am not sure if a global setting (all or nothing) or a realm permission to allow per-site functionality would be best or possible.  I am not a developer, so we'd need to have both community and developer feedback on what might be possible.
h1. IMPORT/EXPORT CONSIDERATIONS

You raise an important point that the import/export to a spreadsheet must be addressed. I'm in full agreement with you! I think that any internationalization items would need to be evaluated as well. Thanks for bringing this up.
h1. ITEM LABEL

Some professors can get confused about extra credit items, so I understand your concern about confusion.

By the way, the motivation behind the original, proposed label of ""Penalty item"" was due to the fact that professors were asking for a way to penalize students for a behavior, such as missing class.  In discussion internally here, the option of ""Negative credit item"" was floated and dismissed as wording.  While ""Negative credit item"" would seem like an opposite of ""Extra credit item,"" a penalty isn't a ""credit.""  We felt that ""penalty"" was an appropriate label for the purpose of the item.  Open to other wording, of course.

To address your concern about instructor confusion, perhaps the addition of a question-mark icon to the right of each selection item with an accessible content box to offer more context about these options might help?  The added description for extra credit might be something like ""To offer the option of awarding extra points. If selected, this gradebook item's point value will not affect the overall total points possible in the course. Any value entered for each student will improve their grade.""  Perhaps a description for penalty item might be: ""To offer the option to deduct points. If selected, the gradebook item's point value will not affect the overall total points possible in the course. Any value entered for each student will reduce their grade."" (I'm sure better descriptions can be written, esp. related to points/percentages, but a little extra info at their fingertips might help instructors understand the intent for each item?)
h1. DATA ENTRY

Regarding the request – if the ""Penalty"" item option was pursued (with whatever label is appropriate), I would recommend that whether the value was entered as a positive number or a negative number, it would be treated as a negative number on entry.  So, if entered as ""5"", it would record as ""-5.""  If entered as ""-5"" it would record as ""-5.""  No need for any pop-up or warning that only negative values are allowed; it is a penalty item, so any value should be negative, not positive. At least this is my perspective...

 
h1. ASSESSING NEED

To your point about popularity of this request, we have had several professors ask for a penalty capability in the Gradebook at our institution since we originally posted the feature request.  From undergraduate to graduate classes, some professors wish to have the option for a penalty.  Admittedly, it's not a majority of instructors, but there are enough voices to merit consideration.  (And it sounds like another institution is also interested in this feature request.)

h1. WORKAROUNDS

Some of the workarounds have included using the grade override to numerically adjust the grade, but with this option there is no line item on the gradebook that communicates to a student, ""You lost X points because of Y.""

Some have used an attendance category and gradebook item like you suggested, but in the case of a philosophy or grade schema that does not give any credit to attendance... this becomes problematic.  This approach runs counter to the concept of not rewarding attendance (just penalizing absence).  At least, that has been the criticism/feedback from professors when this workaround has been presented. They feel strongly that a negative value is appropriate in their situation. (An item named ""Absence Penalty"" with a value of -5 would stand out, communicate an attendance problem, and prompt a discussion (if merited). An instructor could add a comment like ""Missed classes on Jan 12 and Feb 9"" to add even more detail, for example.)

It seems like both Canvas and Brightspace allow negative values to be entered in a gradebook cell.  So, another solution is simply to allow negative values to be entered into any Gradebook item cell.   I know that some schools are concerned about data entry errors (accidental negative values rather than intended negative values).  I believe that the ""penalty/negative credit item"" approach would address both concerns and offer additional grading flexibility. 

My $0.02!","28-Jul-2020 17:02;rainribbon;Hi [~alanregan], honestly, I'd just prefer allowing users to enter a negative number in the gradebook.  The paradigm exists already in _Tests & Quizzes_ for score adjustments.

Currently, if you enter more points than the total point value of an item, such that it would be providing extra credit, a plus icon appears in the grade cell to indicate that it is worth more than the total point value and thus giving extra credit.

 !higherscore.png|thumbnail! 

A similar icon could be employed to denote a negative value, e.g., the [fa-minus-square icon|https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icon/minus-square] in red.

Since I thought there must be a technical reason why we don't allow Gradebook to accept negative scores, I did a quick test using _Tests & Quizzes_ adjustment field, to see if I could break the calculations (and potentially find an overly complicated, clumsy workaround for your instructors):
# Created a quiz with a short answer/essay question worth 1 point, and sent this quiz to the Gradebook.
# Submitted the quiz as a dummy ""student"" (a gmail address I added to my site as a guest user).
# Went to the *Scores* for the quiz and for a student in the course who had not submitted, entered -10 in the Adjustment column.

Gradebook ""took the bait"" as it were, and happily accepted the negative quiz score, with the correct final score calculation.

 !negativequizscore.png|thumbnail! 

So, if you really want to force a penalty score, it seems you can use a quiz with a title like ""Poor Attendance Penalty"" that you manually submit with a guest account to gain access to its _Total Scores_ screen (and to prevent actual students from submitting it, set its due date in the past immediately after you've made your submission).

As long as you don't enter any score for a student, the dummy quiz's point value won't be considered in their grade calculation, so you can use it exclusively for penalizing those who did not submit.  And if a student were to submit the quiz inadvertently before you got it off the screen, you could excuse the offending 0 grade so it would be removed from their calculation.","06-Aug-2020 13:29;davideveland;I think I'm with Allen on this. While our objective is not necessarily to keep up with the Jones', providing some level of parity is appropriate and being able to do so with an intuitive rather than hidden workflow is likely best.

I have not had much inquiry into this kind of feature from my faculty, but the use case is (as Tiffany points out) already present in T&Q and while I'd be leading faculty down a rabbit hole to implement such an odd workflow now, it makes it all the more reason why creating some means of an intuitive interface is appropriate IMHO.","07-Aug-2020 07:36;rainribbon;My concern [~davideveland] is that instructors will not understand a new type of item or category, as they already have trouble comprehending how the Extra Credit items/categories are calculated.  That's why I'd rather simply allow negative values to be entered for any item.","07-Aug-2020 16:05;alanregan;Thanks, [~davideveland].  I agree that offering an intuitive or at least evident feature is important. And being able to offer comparable (if not better!) functionality can help address faculty use cases. Appreciate the comment.

[~rainribbon], I always value your feedback.  If I hear the concern correctly, because faculty members are confused about how to use extra credit today (and I agree – some do get confused), this new feature shouldn't be pursued?  Perhaps we can address the confusion factor +_and_+ provide the new feature?

Here is a potential mockup. It's a draft and I'm sure it can be improved.

IMAGE 1: Proposed checkbox for new functionality.

!gradebook-penalty-item-1.png!

IMAGE 2: Proposed option if the ""Learn more"" link is clicked below the new checkbox option.

!gradebook-penalty-item-2.png!

Again, just suggestions. I'm hoping for a win-win – to address a faculty need for a penalty item and also to address Tiffany's point to improve the language and direction to reduce instructor confusion about the existing feature. This new proposal combines the functionality... but I am open to splitting it again if the approach of new language or a ""Learn more"" link (or ""i"" icon) seems like a possible direction?

P.S. I am proposing that – if selected – the validation for the ""Point value"" field is adjusted to any whole number which is zero or greater (not greater than zero).  A standard gradebook item would retain the greater-than-zero requirement. I thought that this might also help Tiffany's point about faculty confusion or give professors comfort that they could set the item to zero points if desired.","07-Aug-2020 17:12;rainribbon;[~alanregan] to clarify, I definitely think the option to penalize students should be pursued!  My concern is about implementation and making it easy for users to understand.

I think it will be confusing to make this feature a unique checkbox instead of just allowing instructors to enter a negative number as the score for an existing item in the Gradebook.  As far as I can tell from testing with the grades coming from _Tests & Quizzes_, there's no *technical* reason to prevent users from entering negative numbers for grades.  It seems like the option to enter negative scores was just removed from the Gradebook in a (perhaps misguided) effort to protect students' grades from instructor typos.

If the ""penalty"" is going to be its own item and category type, I don't think it should be folded into Extra Credit.  Even though the way it is calculated is similar (but negative instead of positive), I feel like changing the Extra Credit item type to include it would confuse users who have been using Extra Credit for a long time.

I don't think a tooltip is adequate to explain the use of the ""penalty"" item, for the following reasons:
* Tooltips are difficult to make accessible to low vision users (those who do not use a screen reader, but do use high zoom)
* Tooltips are difficult to make accessible on touchscreens/mobile devices.
* Too much text is required to explain it to be appropriate for a tooltip.

Based on the suggestion that allowing negative points will fix the problem... how does the group suggest that these issues are addressed?
 * To accomplish the goal of a penalty item, instructors will need to make an ""extra credit item"" so that the point total does not impact the total points possible.  Won't the label ""extra credit"" be confusing to instructors since it has a positive suggestion (adding points vs. deducting points)?
 * As it currently stands, won't instructors be forced to place a positive point value for that ""extra credit"" gradebook item (which will be confusing if the item is intended as a ""penalty"" column – which would impact instructors and students alike, correct)?
 * By design, it looks like this approach will be a secret hack rather than a visible option?

I posit that a designed approach will be far less confusing than a top secret (and arguably counter-intuitive?) approach. 

That said, if the following items are considered, I hope we can arrive at a good solution:
 * Feature Label: The label for extra credit should be modified to avoid a secret hack approach (e.g. adjustment item, extra credit or penalty item, etc.).  If folks are truly convinced that the existing ""extra credit item"" is confusing today, then what harm will changing the label to ""Extra credit or penalty item"" truly do?  I can't see that it makes matters worse, and this proposed change has the opportunity to make things better with additional options to learn more (which I feel can be done without a tool tip and meet all accessibility needs).
 * Item Point Value: Changing the data validation on the ""point value"" field from ""greater than zero"" to ""greater than or equal to zero"" is important; I feel strongly that we need to allow people choosing this item type to make the points possible zero for the item.  At the very least, change the validation once someone selects that it's an extra credit/penalty item.  This change would benefit both extra credit and penalty item users.  We often get questions why instructors need to place a positive value in an optional ""extra credit"" column, so I think this would be a win-win.
 * Negative Values: As discussed, change the gradebook spreadsheet to allow the direct instructor entry of negative values – at least within an extra credit/penalty item. 

Thank you for considering my thoughts. I hope I'm making sense! ","19-Aug-2020 11:58;rainribbon;[~alanregan], per the discussion in the T&L call, there would be two components to this:
# Allow instructors to set the minimum value of a gradebook item to 0.
# Allow instructors to enter negative numbers for the scores.

Wouldn't setting the point value of the item to 0 achieve the same goal of not impacting the total score for the course?

A 0-point item would also provide an option for instructors who prefer to grant extra credit by simply adding on points (without a specified value for the extra credit).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ISSUE

A user claims that they can't see a site.  An admin uses ""User Membership"" to check.  The site appears on the list, which makes it seem like user error.  However, if the site was marked for deletion (soft delete) there is no indication on the admin's ""User Membership"" to communicate this information.

Please add some type of indication on the administrative ""User Membership"" tool if a site has been marked for deletion.  This will help technical support staff understand why a user can't see a site and help to speed up a resolution to the problem (whether communication that the class has been canceled or that the admin needs to restore the site from the softly deleted sites area).

*NOTE:* This request is based on real-world experience. The lack of information in the ""User Membership"" page led to unnecessary troubleshooting and wasted time for both parties (and frustration on behalf of the instructor).

I was thinking of working on pasteFromGoogleDoc (and possibly ckawesome), but should those plugins be 'default' plugins or should they be ""extra"" / ""webjar"" plugins... e.g. like the a11y checker plugin?  where you have to compile the sakai code with the maven option -Pcompile-skin,ckeditor-extras ","24-Apr-2019 15:36;lgekeler;[~austinUH] I don't know the technical answer to your question but maybe this conversation thread will help you - the community has been talking about experimenting with these plug-ins in such a way that they can more quickly be removed or incorporated in the OOTB distro, once the community gets a chance to explore them inside of Sakai. Does that help at all?","24-Apr-2019 16:32;austinUH;Hello [~lgekeler],  Thank you for your quick reply.  

As far as making the plugins ""more quickly be removed or incorporated in the OOTB distro"".  (hahaha, I had to google ""OOTB"")  I'm not sure what you had I mind, but it would be cool if those plugins (maybe also the a11y plugin) could be configured in sakai.properties.  Though I'd think that would be a bit tricky?  Perhaps some variables could be injected into ckeditor.launch.js?  And those plugins could then be moved from the ckeditor-extras maven profile to the standard profile (so you wouldn't need to compile with the -Pcompile-skin,ckeditor-extras option I mentioned above)? I mean, you'd still need to compile in the plugins (including any new or future plugins), but it would be great if they could be enabled / disabled via sakai.properties.

hmm... actually, we'd also need to check the plugin license.  e.g. the a11ychecker plugin is in the ckeditor-extras profile (/webjars/pom.xml) because 

""This profile contains addons where the licensing is incompatible and they can't be distributed""

but the [a11ychecker|https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/a11ychecker] and [balloonpanel|http://example.com] plugin pages say GPL?  I'm not too familiar with licensing. Can Sakai redistribute it?  Did they change their license since it was added to the ckeditor-extras profile?","25-Apr-2019 15:11;lgekeler;[~sfoster9] [~ern]  These are all GPL licensed plug-ins, but the real question is what would be the best way to install them to experiment, given that as GPL they are all eligible to be included in Sakai's OOTB distribution?

If full automation seems too tricky from a programatic aspect, then It may even be useful to incorporate a semi-automatic solution that requires, say, 1 or 2 steps as opposed to the workflow that is currently needed for each session.

For example, having a ""google calendar"" link that, when clicked by the instructor, opens Google calendar in another tab in the web-browser, auto-fills the calendar event details along with the invitee(s), and all the user need do is click ""Save.""

Regarding the comments from the Core Team call, here are my $0.02:
 * I would think in anonymous grading that the picture could be replaced with the ""no picture"" graphic and the student identity obscured
 * A screenshot was provided
 * Granular control or a system-wide property would be useful
 * Permissions should perhaps defer to the roster permissions for viewing pictures (after all, if I could see pictures in the roster, why shouldn't I in the Assignment)

Lastly, an overall observation is that the picture which is shown in Messages currently is the Profile picture, and there is no capability of showing the Official picture should one exist.  We haven't forced the Official picture at our institution because we wanted people to have choice – but it does raise the question of whether tools that show pictures should have a radio button to show Profile pictures or Official pictures. ","18-Apr-2019 19:28;mark_golbeck;I tested this after uploading a profile image to two students profiles.

I think this needs to be implemented on a *per-tool basis*, with a *property* to control at an institutional level which tools it applies to.

For _Tests & Quizzes_, I think this would be an extremely dangerous option for the following reasons:
 # Very often, dates need to be inspected and edited before publishing to make quizzes available to students.  Automatically publishing without checking dates can be problematic, especially if the instructor releases feedback at a specific date, because the feedback becomes immediate if it is before the latest submission date of the quiz (see SAK-34476).
 # You cannot change the *Release to* setting after a quiz is published - if a quiz was for specific groups in the original site, the instructor should inspect the settings before publishing to make sure *Entire Site* is the desired release target (or select the appropriate release target).
 # This has repercussions outside of T&Q, Gradebook, and Calendar if links were created to the quizzes on lesson pages.  Currently, all quiz links ought to be automatically eliminated, requiring the instructor to link to appropriate new quizzes.  In this case, the link migration would need to be modified to pick up the quiz ID of the new associated quizzes and update them automatically.
Failing to update the links will result in the issue of students not being able to access the quizzes because they will point to quizzes in the old site. This is already a problem for instructors who copy/paste content that includes quiz links created in CKEditor (instead of using import, which appropriately removes the old quiz links).","29-Nov-2018 07:53;lgekeler;

Instructors want to use the IP Address column to check on suspected cases of cheating.  For example, assuming dorm IPs are in a different address range from the IPs elsewhere on campus, having all IPs listed might help instructors to catch a student who starts a test in the classroom, leaves to go back to their dorm room and look up answers, and submits from the dorm room.  Consequently, all IP addresses where the student had a specific test open should be shown. So for example:

*+Overview:+*

We have recently received requests for accessing up to 4 years’ worth of student Sakai-stored work and downloading it for their personal archive. We frequently receive this request, since students cannot access their work after they graduate but often need it for several different purposes such as job interviews and resumes.

The question from our student group survey was stated:

*If Sakai had a button that said “Download All My Work from the Past 4 years from all my Sakai Course Sites”, would you use it?*

98% of our students who took the survey said they would use such a button.

We certainly see this feature’s enormous potential/appeal to our students and our community users.

*+Feature request:+* ability for students to download all of their work for their personal archive.

While Sakai has many tools and student’s work may be uploaded into many of these different tools, such as dropbox and assignments, the goal would be to create a “One button” feature to download all students’ work at once. We certainly see one possible side effect of overwhelming students with a long list of their works. So it would be nice if we could provide students with a full listing of their work, so that students can select from options of either downloading their desired files or downloading all of them.

Thank you for considering this feature request.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SAK-40409,SAK-41722,SAK-43334,SAK-39533,SAK-33457,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,,,,"0|10biew:",9223372036854775807,,Please add a Test Plan here.,,,Not started,,,,,,,"19-Jun-2018 09:51;rainribbon;This is a great idea and would be very helpful to students, but I suspect it would be very hard to implement.

In that case, though, it would probably have to be an option to ""Download all my submissions from assignments in this site"".

[~euksa99] in the short term, you might recommend that students save their work to *Home > My Resources* and then they can either use WebDAV to download their resources or (assuming they have enough space left in *My Resources*) compress their resources to a zip file and download the zip to store.

There was a tool created that allows instructors to download all student content [https://github.com/steveswinsburg/sakai-archiver]

   ""One button download"" of all student submissions (their own intellectual property) per course in a zip. 
We could start with zipping up student uploaded attachments (even from unpublished sites) through a tool situated in a student's Home site. We could start with one kind of content, such as assignments, but eventually this should include all student-owned content.
They should have visibility into their content with options to download to zip.

Sadly, the tool can't be used directly for this because I'm generating a zipped JSON file and (optionally) only include the resources as a  base64-encoded JSON value and not as separate files.","03-Jun-2020 11:01;alanregan;Student-related work might include:
 * *Assignments* (Uploaded content and submitted rich text content; wrinkle = group assessments?)
 * *Chat Room* (Not sure how you manage this... Exclude? FERPA, GDPR, CCPA, or other privacy law concerns?)
 * *Commons* (Not sure how you manage this... Exclude? FERPA, GDPR, CCPA, or other privacy law concerns?)
 * *Drop Box* (All content in the student's folder or just content uploaded by the student directly? Some professors share docs with students, so I am assuming that all content would be acceptable, but this should be discussed.)
 * *Email / Email Archive / Messages* (Exclude? In theory, they could or should have cc'd their outside email address.)
 * *Forums* (We receive the occasional inquiry that graduate students for an ""archive"" of the class forum discussions; they often want the shared links or article quotes or references, along with specific conversations. We direct them to the ""print"" view of a thread and inform them to print to PDF any desired forum threads. I am not sure, given FERPA, GDPR, CCPA, or other privacy laws whether any export should only include posts by the student; I don't see a way to exclude content that was ""quoted"" within a student post, however. Potentially tricky?)
 * *Gradebook* (Save the page as a PDF for them or exclude since it's easy for them to ""print"" the page to PDF themselves?)
 * *Lessons* (Thinking specifically about ""Student Content"" Pages. I imagine that the ""Comments"" feature would be similar to Chat Room / Commons in complexity to include and might be excluded?)
 * *Podcasts* (It's possible to modify the permissions to allow student uploads. Files go into Resources, so would roll up to a Resources export option?) 
 * *Resources* (Some professors create folders and provide access to students to upload content; include content where the creator was the student username? Would requiring the copyright status option at an institution help with including or excluding content?)
 * *Tests & Quizzes* (Should likely be excluded, but some ""essays"" and ""files"" are submitted; a hard exclusion should be made clear)
 * *Wiki* (Challenging? Exclude?)

Apologies if I am missing any other tools that might be relevant. 

I'm assuming that any project would be a multi-phase approach.  I'd imagine that Assignments and Drop Box might be the easiest to start with? ","03-Jun-2020 11:48;rainribbon;*Additional consideration:* What about assignments with submissions, or Drop Box submissions that an instructor deleted?  Should students still be able to get their submissions from those? If so, should there be a forced and permanent ""soft delete"" for all submission attachments?  There may also be cases (e.g., a Nursing class where a student inadvertently uploaded a submission that violated HIPPA restrictions) where it is desirable to hard delete content.

I have no doubt that instructors would be angry if students could download their own submissions to high-stakes exams (whether created in _Tests & Quizzes_ or _Assignments_), even if it would've been possible for students to save the content locally beforehand - I've worked with several instructors recently who have inquired about making it as difficult as possible for students to retain exam questions or submissions of any kind.  Instructors with concerns about this often make it part of their exam honor policy that students should not be saving, long-term, any exam content.

I feel very strongly that _Tests & Quizzes_ should be excluded unless the instructor has explicitly released feedback that is available at the time the student exports AND includes *Questions* and *Student Response*.  I also think the instructor should have an option to ""opt out"" of allowing student downloads from a particular assignment (in case it's a high-stakes assessment that was created within the _Assignments_ tool) - See also the feature request in SAK-41722.  Some on the T&L call disagreed, indicating that the student should still ""own"" that information if they submitted it, and thus be able to download it regardless of the instructor's preferences.

I think the following should definitely be excluded:
* Chat Room - Not intended for submitting papers/assignments, doesn't seem relevant, and I suspect that most comments in chat won't make sense out of context.
* Gradebook - Doesn't include any content the student authored, only graders' feedback to students.
* Wiki - How can you identify specific content created by the student in question?  The content they last modified might have been created by others initially.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.5/en/news-5-5-3.html

and when you create a database you can specify the default character set.","28-Mar-2017 08:19;buckett;Ah, yeah, on KNL-1431, it's because of the longer indexes.","28-Mar-2017 08:46;jonespm;Yeah it ""can"" work on earlier version but it is easier if things are defaults. MySQL 5.7.9 made the dynamic indexes the default as stated on the JRA issue https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-36135

""Jan Lindström unfortunately this still only allows index keys longer than 767 bytes on tables with row format of DYNAMIC or COMPRESSED, but the default format is COMPACT in versions below MySQL 5.7.9. It's not possible to change the default row format at the database as far as I have found.""

Though it looks like it can be only be specified as the global/default or on the table level, this would still take some work for Sakai. And you couldn't make this a global since likely many databases share a server. When utf8mb4 is the default (over utf8) then you just don't have to expect that people read the manual to create their database correctly. Though whether it's utf8 or utf8mb4 as long as the indexes are bigger it should be fine.

So the big amount of work would be on all the conversions, hibernate changes, auto.ddl changes, validators and such to make the these fields indexed 33% larger. Seems like a lot of effort to for the end result. Though having longer indexes (and lengths) on many fields I think would be a bigger benefit than emojis. ","12-Feb-2018 09:55;jonespm;Here's another writeup of a process we'd have to go through. 

I feel like coming up with a generic conversion should be doable by queering all tables from the information schema, generating the SQL dynamically and running it.
https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/104866/85328
https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/mysql-utf8mb4

The problem is that the max key length is still 767. So we'd also need to have a dymanic SQL generated to change all tables to dynamic row format.
ALTER TABLE t1 ENGINE=INNODB ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC;

Then we'd probably want to increase a number of column sizes since we can go a lot larger. Has anyone worked on a script process or tested this for Sakai? 

","12-Feb-2018 16:39;jonespm;I created this script based on the ideas here. Just need to fill in the database and run this. Locally it's looking good after SAK-31937 in Sakai 12. Might want to give this more of a look in 13. I don't know how to easily automate this, and if we do try to increase any column sizes we'd have to make sure people run this. (And new installations create with the correct types too!)

If the matches are going to be in the drop-downs themselves, they would have to be text only.  I wonder if some searches could be done in the database at various institutions to help decide if users have used extensive formatting on the matches, and whether it would be feasible to simply eliminate the editor option for *match* fields?

We suggest removing the HTML editor part from the Match field (the answer that appears under the ""Response""). Also potentially limiting the number of characters in this field, if we were to use [~rainribbon]'s mockup. 

[~jtingen] suggested to develop a query to determine the types of content that instructors put in the Match/Response field, so we have use-case data for these possible changes.

We found approximately 100 users with affected questions at UVA.  In most cases, the formatting in the match fields appears to be minimal (bold, italics, using Times New Roman font instead of Helvetica) or the questions came up in the search because they included special characters (e.g., quotation marks, commas).  A few questions do have relatively long *match* text.  In each question with long match text that I've reviewed, if the current *match* text were moved to the *choice* field, and the current *choice* text moved to the corresponding *match* field, the question would be equally valid.

I think something needs to be done to improve the usability of this question type, but there may be a better way to do it than the mock-ups I included in the description.

I was recently working with an instructor who had some matching questions that included LaTeX in both the *choice* and *match* fields, so I don't think it's a viable option to remove HTML formatting from the *match* field altogether.  We would need an accessible way to make the drop-down include HTML elements, and yet potentially still restrict the types of HTML allowed (It would be a problem, for example, if the instructor attempted to embed videos in a *match* that would populate the drop-down).

Yeah there'd be a PR once some work is done on this. The code was around the property ""portal.scrolling.toolbar.enabled"" and the value scrollingToolbarEnabled. It's also similar values in the velocity files. I guess if someone implemented SAK-42397 it might either re-use this property or also remove this as it would probably touch the same code. Though maybe it wouldn't need a property and just be enabled. I haven't looked at this.

Another option would be to add this (and any other customizable display settings) to the preferences tool. 

It might be valuable for [~wilma@longsight.com], [~cebristow], or [~psg3a@virginia.edu] to bring this request to the attention of the Teaching & Learning Group so that they can consider how this feature should be prioritized, and if so, how it should best be implemented. ","20-May-2020 09:59;lgekeler;T&L discussed this but found it more complex than it first seems.

UX will also discuss this jira.","20-May-2020 11:43;sfoster9;We discussed this at today's UX Group call. 

Some of the options that we discuss:
# all dropdowns in all tools will remember the last-selected size option per user
# all dropdowns in a particular tool will remember the last-selected size option for that tool for that user
# allow users to set their size preference in Preferences for all tools
# allow users to set their size preference in Preferences for each tool

We didn’t like the idea of an instructor changing students’ preferences. 

We discussed how other types of table views, such as infinite scroll, might remove the need for fixing this pagination

Our Proposal:
- Create a new Preferences page that list all tools with the table size selection dropdown
-- Have a global setting of the user’s preferred size for all these dropdowns (e.g. ""Select default page size for all tools"")
-- Have individual settings for each tool (e.g. ""Select default page size for Announcements"")
- Update these preferences when the dropdown size is changed for a table in a particular tool for the table
-- Update the global setting, unless the global has been unchecked, in which case update the particular tool's preference
- The performance of these custom changes may need to be evaluated

Gradebook > Excuse Empty Cells,SAK-42494,86199,New Feature,Awaiting Review,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project.

If you try to excuse a cell that contains a null (empty) value, it will appear to the instructor – briefly – that the activity for the student was excused as the calculator icon (with a slash through it) will display. But upon refreshing the Gradebook (or navigating back to Gradebook at a later time), the instructor will observe that the icon (and therefore the excuse action) didn't ""stick"" and the activity is no longer excused. 

The current functionality seems to work well for excusing scores *_after-the-fact_*. That is, if a student scores poorly, and offers a valid explanation +and/or+ asks for an alternative way to make up the score, the instructor can excuse the already recorded score and move forward. 

But what about scenarios that arise when a student alerts the instructor *_ahead-of-time_* that he/she will not be able to participate in the graded activity?

For example, assume an instructor creates Gradebook items for weekly participation, and a student informs the instructor that he/she will not be able to attend class next week. In this case, there is no need to input an arbitrary/unearned score that won't happen. The instructor simply wants to navigate to the empty cell corresponding to the student and mark it as _excused_.

Now, it could be argued that the instructor could just leave the cell empty since an empty cell won't be calculated against the student's overall grade. And, optionally, the instructor could just simply input a comment in the empty cell clarifying that the cell is empty because the score is excused.

But there are several problems with this approach:
 * The absence of the calculator icon (with a slash through it) does not make it immediately clear to instructors (or students) that the empty cell is not being counted against the student's overall score. The presence of this icon, at a quick glance, is reassuring that the score is, indeed, excused, and reinforces that the cell is not empty because the instructor missed inputting a score.
 * The instructor may find it burdensome to need to type in a comment for every single pre-excused activity. 
 * It promotes an inconsistent procedure for excusing scores. That is, recorded scores are excused one way (cell drop-down > excuse/include grade), unrecorded scores are excused another way (leave the cell blank). 

This feature request will be particularly useful for larger class sizes (50+), where the instructor:
 * doesn't see the usefulness of first inputting arbitrary/unearned scores and _then_ excusing them (it's just extra steps)
 * wants to be able to quickly glance at the Gradebook, and see that a score is excused. An empty cell does not make this immediately transparent, and the calculator icon (with a slash through it) already communicates that the score is excused in lieu of needing to type in a comment. 

Thank you for considering!

This procedure seems to show that excusing an empty cell is not allowed, despite first appearing to be the case. The description below, hopefully, highlights the usefulness of this feature request.",,,Not started,,,,,,,"19-Sep-2019 14:46;rainribbon;I don't think the option to excuse grades should even be available in the menu for empty cells.  If there's no grade, there's nothing to excuse.  The item is already not being included in the course grade.

I think for accessibility, it would be better to simply not make the option available.  If you allow the instructor to excuse a null grade in advance, there would need to be an added alert, which grabs focus and is readable by a screen reader, if they entered an actual grade later, to warn them that the new grade is still being excused, and if they want it to count, they need to lift the exclusion.

Normally, if a student doesn't attend class, they would get a *0* for attendance/participation for that class day.  The instructor in the use case described should be assigning and excusing the 0 score.

You mentioned that the calculator icon is not present for students when a grade cell is empty/null.  The calculator icon and strikethrough text on a grade, anywhere it displays, has a very specific meaning: a grade was entered, but it is excluded from the course grade calculation.  If you click on the icon, it will display the (relatively lengthy) text that is read to a screen reader user every time the calculator is encountered on the screen, which indicates that the grade is either being excluded or dropped by the category drop/keep settings.  If students are having difficulty understanding that a blank/null grade has no impact on their course grade, I think it would be more appropriate to add a message at the top of the _Gradebook_ screen for students to indicate that blank grades are not affecting their course grade, than to display calculator icons for ungraded items.","20-Sep-2019 19:02;alanregan;*A possible idea:* If a cell is empty (null value) and an instructor selects ""Excuse/Include Grade,"" the process should save the instructor time by populating a zero into the cell and then excusing the grade.  After the action, the cell should display a zero with a strikethrough and the calculator with the slash icon.

The value or benefit is that this one step would save the instructor an otherwise two-step process.  This would be a potential time-saver for faculty.

At our institution, student-athletes or members of other teams (e.g. debate team) will know their ""away"" schedules in advance. If an instructor uses gradebook columns to tally daily attendance, this feature would allow an instructor to mark future class items as excused ahead of time.

While I view this feature request as a ""nice-to-have"" vs. a ""must-have,"" it does provide an efficiency gain for instructors.","23-Sep-2019 16:19;rainribbon;I guess it would be fine if the cell populated with a 0 which it also nulled out, but how would you communicate that effectively to a screen reader user? A warning pop-up where they have to confirm, with a message like the following?

{quote}This grade cell is empty.  It will be automatically populated with a 0 that will then be excused.{quote}

It seems to me that it would be much harder to develop a change that would make the automatic addition and nulling of a zero grade clear to all users than to simply remove the Excuse Grade option from the drop-down if no grade is present to excuse.

Is it really so onerous for these faculty members to type a 0 in the grade cell before selecting the *Excuse Grade* option?  They place focus in the cell anyway to get to the menu with the option.","13-May-2020 14:13;rainribbon;I've been looking back at UVA's grade exclusions feature in _Gradebook Classic_ for some testing today, and I noticed that it is possible, in the _Gradebook Classic_ feature, to exclude a null grade.

 !null-excluded1.png|thumbnail! 

If you go to the student's individual page (where you can enter grades regardless of whether exclusions are applied) and input a value in the same cell afterwards, it simply remains excluded.

 !enteredexcluded2.png|thumbnail! 

The exclusion must then be removed to include the grade in the course grade calculation.

 !exclusionremoved3.png|thumbnail! 

The difference between this feature and Gradebook NG's is that the GB Classic checkbox for enabling grade exclusion stood out more on the page than NG's calculator icon, which is also used for dropped grades.

A suggestion for this feature request:
# Allow instructor to excuse null grade cell.
# When instructor does this, empty grade cell is replaced with the calculator icon and text display *Excused* that you can get keyboard or mouse focus on but not type over the ""excused"" text directly - when you try to select it, it gives you a pop-up like the following (with the bold text below as two different button options):
{quote}[Student name] has had the grade for [item title] excused.  Do you want to remove the excused grade to enter a grade for this student?

*Yes - Remove Excuse* | *No*{quote}

Consequently, if *Autosubmit* is enabled on a *timed* test, it is possible (extremely rare and impossible to reproduce consistently!) for the *Autosubmit* job to submit a student's quiz before the timer finishes saving and submitting.

This can result in one of the following issues:
# Because *Autosubmit* does NOT save before submitting student work, the student's work may not be saved in their submission.
# A timer-autosubmit race condition can cause the *complete loss of student submissions*.  In the instance we have seen of this, the students actually received email notification of a submission.  However, the *submission confirmation numbers* in those emails are *completely missing* in the database.

To prevent these issues (especially the latter) and ensure that timers can save and submit student work, I recommend preventing the use of Autosubmit on timed tests.

The suggested change would work as follows:
 * Upon selecting the *has a time limit of* check box, the *Autosubmit* check box becomes disabled.
 ** The text _Autosubmit saved student work after latest acceptance date, unless student has previously submitted_ is replaced with the following:
{quote}Autosubmit is disabled for timed tests to avoid conflicts with timer submissions.

How often have you experienced this?","22-Oct-2018 13:38;rainribbon;It should only submit after the quiz has finished.  The problem is that the timer takes a few seconds to save and submit. Thus, if the autosubmit job runs at the precise second when the quiz ends (before the few-second grace period for the timer save/submit completes), it can trump the timer submit.

We have only seen it happen twice and it's nigh impossible to reproduce.  The two cases were as follows:
# A student was working on an essay question and hadn't saved his answer.  Autosubmit hit before the timer and the answer submitted mostly blank (only content he manually saved before the due date was submitted).
# Four students were working on a quiz that had a 15-minute timer and a due date exactly 15 minutes after the available date.  The quiz was due on a 5-min mark (e.g., 12:45 pm), and Autosubmit runs at UVA every 5 minutes on the 5-min marks.  One affected student's submission was processed, but not marked correctly in the database so it didn't display in the UI without developer intervention.  The other three affected students' submissions were completely lost in the database.  One of the students received an email notification of successful automatic submission, but the submission confirmation number did not exist anywhere in the database.

Ideally, the Autosubmit job would be ""smart"" enough not to interfere with a timer submit.","22-Oct-2018 14:49;sfoster9;Thanks for confirming and clarifying, [~rainribbon]. 

On today's Sakai Jira Triage call, [~ern] suggested adding a grace period (e.g. 15 minutes) between the end of quizzes and when the quiz would be autosubmitted.

We recommend putting both comments and grade changes in the same log, which displays in a modal window. Long comments could be truncated (maybe 200 characters) and ellipsed to indicate there's more.

Improve Default Message in Pop-Up when leaving Student Review Mode,SAK-42412,86108,New Feature,Awaiting Review,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project.

(see screenshot).

While a warning is useful here, the wording of this warning does not seem to capture the spirit of what it is really trying to convey.

To an instructor, this message can stop them in their tracks and come across as: ""All the *unreleased* grades you've inputted for students will become visible to them (i.e. on their end)."" 

Our understanding is that this message is intended to warn instructors that navigating away from Student Review Mode will expose scores *on their own computer screen*.

Use Case: if an instructor is privately meeting with a student in office hours, the instructor can enter ""Student Review Mode"" for the respective student, share his/her computer screen with the student to discuss progress, and if the instructor attempts to navigate away from ""Student Review Mode"" while the student is still looking over their shoulder, the warning is intended to warn/remind the instructor that the full Gradebook containing all student scores will become exposed on their own screen if they click ""Continue.""

Given this intended purpose, we propose new wording/language in the pop-up, such as:
----
*""You are about to leave Student Review Mode.""*

""Exiting Student Review Mode will display the names and grades of other students and/or return you to the full grade report for the current student (which may contain unreleased grades). If you are meeting with a student, please adjust your screen or computer to protect student grades.""

You would have to move most of the Action code probably off to something that can generate JSON and use that. But I agree it still could be up toward 100 hours or so. The UI currently is pretty bad and features like this one really are needed somehow.

Sometimes professors make a mistake when crafting an exam.  In these situations, they may want to ""throw out"" or exclude a specific question from the exam.  Currently, there is not an easy way to accomplish this in the Tests & Quizzes tool.  At the moment, professors would need to go into the assessment and manually assign the points for the question to each student -- which is laborious.

We are requesting an option, perhaps in ""Questions"" or ""Statistics"" (or both!) to offer professors a simple checkbox to exclude the question from the assessment.  This would ""throw out"" the question as if it wasn't part of the assessment.  While faculty and students would see the question and the answers, the point value would be zero and students would receive zero points (whether they answered it right or wrong).

We feel that this would be a valuable feature for professors at multiple institutions and hope that you will consider this for a release soon.  Thank you!

Have you tested on an instance that allows the instructor to republish and regrade an already-published assessment?","28-Aug-2012 19:58;alanregan;No, I don't have access to an instance with these settings.  For the integrity of the assessment, I am not sure if that would be positive or a dangerous thing for professors.

For those schools that don't allow this setting, the goal here is an easy exclude checkbox next to the questions in the Scores area that would basically throw out a ""bad"" question.  Professors do this often with paper tests, saying that Question 10 was tossed out due to a problem.  So if a test was 100 points and Q10 was worth 2 points, then the exam total is changed to 98 and any result for Q10 would be excluded from calculations (students would neither suffer nor benefit from Q10).  For the sake of statistics, this would be helpful for the professor to avoid asking that question again or learn from the issue when crafting a new assessment.","29-Aug-2012 06:10;ottenhoff;I have enabled editing and regarding of published assessments on qa29.longsight.com.","14-Aug-2017 13:59;ncaidin;Bulk closing issues that have not been updated since 2014 and earlier.

this i a little bit tricky. If you have small timeslots as you mentioned and not only one or two attendees. Then the calendar gets very quickly confusing. I think the current default behavior is good. But for custom timeslots it should behave like you described and not only be displayed if two timeslots have a gap of 2 hours or more. 

Attached you can find some screenshots that show how it behaves on our instance and a very small patch. If I 've time I could make it configurable in a property file

After 30 minutes, the message is no longer editable by the author (unless the user is an instructor or admin with editing permissions for all posts.) 

The rationale for this feature is that students often post things, and then immediately notice a typo or other mistake after posting. It would be nice for students to be able to go back and fix a simple mistake right away. 

Moodle has a feature similar to this, and the amount of time for editing can be set system-wide by the administrator. If this were to be implemented in Sakai, there should be a setting (either in the admin GUI or in the sakai.properties file) where the admin may designate the amount of editing time allowed after posting.  

Some additional considerations:
 * Forum notifications should not go out to subscribed users until after the editing window is elapsed. 
 * If the forum topic has a cut-off date associated with it, the date and time limit for the overall topic should be respected (i.e. the editing window should not extend past the specified topic end date).
 * If the topic is set up for ""Require users to post before reading"" the other posts in that topic should not become visible until after the editing window has elapsed.

The only real difference is that after X minutes the draft would be auto published. I feel like the concept is similar.

The information here may not be 100% accurate, please update or comment if any of the fields need updating.
","02-Jan-2019 09:08;lgekeler;Design Principle: Every ""do"" should have an ""UNdo"".","02-Jan-2019 09:14;rainribbon;Rather than an ""undo"" option, I think it would be easier, programmatically, to have an option ""Set all 0 cells to empty"".

Of course, the problem with that would be if there were additional 0 grades entered manually by the instructor prior to the ""Set empty to zero"" selection.","02-Jan-2019 09:16;lgekeler;The Teaching and Learning group reviewed this JIRA on 2019-01-01, and talked about potential implementations, such as a true Undo button which would undo the last action on any cells set to zero (assuming they could've been set to zero via file upload, via setting all to zero, or via individual cells being set to zero).","03-Jan-2019 12:24;Acolaiac;Setting Empty Cells to 0 also erases comments from the gradebook, which is counter intuitive as the ""cell,"" to the faculty member, does not appear to be ""empty.""","08-Jan-2019 09:30;sfoster9;[~davideveland], are you working on this feature?","08-Jan-2019 10:17;davideveland;[~sfoster9] I am not working on this issue. I started looking into it and assigned it to myself not knowing (at the time) what that does. My apologies. I don't have any dev background. I know I've had a few faculty ask about this, but I've also drummed heavily the 'no undo' function of the set all blanks to 0 function.","08-Jan-2019 10:29;sfoster9;Okay. Thanks, [~davideveland]. I'll unassign you. ","08-Jan-2019 10:30;sfoster9;We discussed this on the Core team call today. We're wondering: is this an immediate undo? Or an undo at any point in time?","08-Jan-2019 11:08;lgekeler;[~sfoster9] Undo at any point in time whatever the last action was.

Set to Zero - Undo : cell becomes blank. Should it be labeled ""Revert"" ?

 ","08-Jan-2019 12:01;sfoster9;So are you suggesting it would be an action for each individual cell? Or an undo action for all cells that were changed?","08-Jan-2019 12:07;rainribbon;My understanding is that the goal is to undo action for all changed cells.  The problem is how that would be implemented - would it be a ""Set all 0 cells to null"" function (in which case it could be done at any point after 0s were entered, but risks eliminating individually-entered 0 scores), or immediately after the change was made to ""Undo Set Empty Score"".  An undo action for each individual cell is not needed, since you can just delete the 0 grade to fix those.

[~davideveland] and [~lgekeler] if it can only be done as an ""Undo Set Empty Score"" immediately after the change is made, might a confirmation warning be helpful?","09-Jan-2019 13:29;sfoster9;Yes, possible implementation were briefly discussed at yesterday's Core Team call. Although, we didn't come to a conclusion. 

A simple undo function, even if it is limited to say ""30 seconds"" after setting empty cells to zero, could cause issues if multiple people are making changes in the Gradebook at the same time. For example, personA clicks the ""Set Zero Score for Empty Cells"" option (which I assume is the option that we are discussing here) and personB then immediately updates one of those zeroes to a value (let's say to ""10""). Then personA thinks ""oh no! undo! undo!"" only 15 seconds later (still within the small 30-second undo window) and clicks the proposed ""Undo"" button. The Undo process would have to check each record from a new list (that needs to be added to Gradebook's database tables each time the ""Set Zero Score for Empty Cells"" button is click) that lists all of the cells that had zeroes applied and change them to blank only if they haven't been changed to a newer grade (e.g. that ""0"" to a ""54"" for a particular student). This requires a lot of extra data to be stored every time the ""Set Zero Score for Empty Cells"" button is clicked. 

What if two different people click the ""Set Zero Score for Empty Cells"" button at any point in time? Or what if you click the button and then create a few columns and click the button again? What would the ""Undo"" function undo? Just the last setting action? Do we need a class-wide grade history? Then we get into versioning, which we all seemed to agree on the call isn't great for Gradebook. And we already have the grade logs for each individual cell. 

I'm all for an ""undo action"", as it is a design rule of a humane interface: ""Every action should be undoable, even after a document or application has been closed and reopened."" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Humane_Interface). However, an elegant solution is needed that takes into account edge cases and avoids adding complexity to other Gradebook tasks and functionality.","09-Jan-2019 13:31;sfoster9;Maybe the simple solution is to set an indicator on each grade when a grade is set to zero by the ""Set Zero Score for Empty Cells"" button and use this indicator as a way to clear zeroes if it is still the current grade value. The indicator could be seen in the Grade Log too, which could be useful for grade review. The indicator could be used by a new set-zeroed-scores-to-empty functionality to act as the ""undo"" function only when the last grade value of that cell is zero and has this indicator. This should address both the cases that I've mentioned above (the zeroes-will-get-updated case and the multiple-presses-of-the-set-to-zero-button case), while also avoiding the case that Tiffany mentioned (the difference between a zeroed grade and a legitimate zero). 

Ya, that might work... :)","09-Jan-2019 13:49;rainribbon;I like that solution, [~sfoster9]!  It would definitely be helpful to know when a 0 was set from a global action vs. individually entered (thinking in particular of sites with multiple instructors, when an instructor accidentally uses the Set Cells to 0 option and another instructor questions why a bunch of students suddenly have 0s).

What would the button be called?  Clear Zero Scores?","15-Dec-2019 13:59;jonespm;I think this could be a good feature and also combined with a better grade log. There are a few issues like SAK-41502 (Excusing a grade should be reflected in the GradeLog) and SAK-33543 (Grade Log doesn't specify grade entry). I think it might be useful if someone could click on a line in the grade log and have the score reverted back to that grade? It should also indicate in the gradelog that the grade was set via an automated cell process and also that the grade was reverted. 

Maybe this could also go along with a new column (Steve's first suggestion) to indicate how the last grade was set? Some ideas

1 - Grade set manually

2 - Grade set via bulk process

3 - Grade set via external tool

4 - Grade reverted from a previous grade

Are there other ways to set the grade?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Address accessibility concerns by providing a palette of accessible background colors for an assessment. The colors should adhere to the appropriate color contrast recommendations to meet accessibility standards (WCAG 2.0 AA or better).
 * Provide a light palette (that could keep the font color as black (#000000)).
 * Provide a dark palette (that would change the base font color for the assessment to white (#ffffff); no instructor action would be necessary).
 * The color picker itself should be keyboard accessible.
 * Upon selecting a color, a sample below the background section should display for instructor review.

Potential benefits:
 * Help professors select a background color that adheres to accessibility guidelines.
 * Support the pedagogical use-case of selecting a background color to help proctors verify that a student is on the assessment and not an unauthorized web page.

 * [https://toolness.github.io/accessible-color-matrix/]

There is a possible opportunity for consistency with color palettes by examining the color choices for Lessons section color schemes (so that if an institution wants to change those colors, it would align in both Lessons and Samigo). Another option could be the palette used by the new profile name color avatar? (Trying to find libraries or services that could be repurposed and could create efficiencies.)","15-Nov-2019 18:32;alanregan;P.S. I'm not necessarily calling for the removal of the HEX color field (where someone could enter any color code), but perhaps a flag or setting could be added in case an institution that is particularly sensitive to color selection might disable the field and only allow selection via an accessible color menu? Just an idea.","18-Nov-2019 08:15;rainribbon;I think it would be a waste of development resources to put additional work into this background color option, which has a very specific, limited use case.  Let's not add complexity to what may be the simplest option available in Samigo.

Like other cases where instructors are allowed to set background colors on text, this will need to be handled with user education, to indicate that they need to use light enough colors so there is sufficient contrast with the black text.","25-Nov-2019 13:51;sfoster9;I'm opening this issue for further discussion about whether this should be a development change or further education.","01-Dec-2019 13:40;alanregan;If the default text color is black, then perhaps we can reduce issues by limiting the color picker to light colors with appropriate contrast?

Else, perhaps a helpful hint near the feature in Settings about color contrast and perhaps a link to a resource like WebAIM's Contrast Checker:

[https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/]

Hopefully, there is an easy fix that would reduce compliance issues for instructors.","02-Dec-2019 08:04;rainribbon;[~alanregan] black is not *just* the *default* text color; it is the *only* color for some text in an assessment - users do *not* have any option to change the text color of the *Table of Contents* link within a quiz, question numbers or the letters that are listed in front of each answer option, the answer options *True* and *False* for true/false questions, or answer options for a few other question types (e.g., survey).

Without *significant development work* (which personally, I think would be a waste of resources), there's no way to limit the color palette of the picker *and* make it impossible for users to select a non-compliant color.  The current color picker is *not* keyboard-accessible, so keyboard users must type a hex value into the box to specify a color.  The following things would need to be done:
# Find and implement an *accessible* jQuery color picker.
# Remove the text box option to enter a color using hex.
# Possibly also remove the option to specify a background image from URL.
# Develop something to either find and automatically fix existing assessment background colors or inform instructors whose existing assessments are potentially affected that they may need to select a new color.

The last item would be the hardest - what can be done to ensure that existing assessments are ""fixed"", if they happen to have a non-compliant color?  You can't eliminate color from some assessments only - it would have to be global for all assessments, or not at all.  Would it even be possible to programmatically identify each affected assessment's color and select a color that is essentially the same, but lighter?","04-Dec-2019 09:53;rainribbon;Per discussion on Teaching & Learning Call, we recommend closing as won't fix due to complexity of fixing of this, and limited use case.","04-Dec-2019 10:23;alanregan;I'm not a programmer, but would something like this work?

In many cases, however, the following are occurring:

1) The pagination controls have unnecessary styling applied to them, which draws unnecessary prominence to the controls when they should fade into the background as much as possible, particularly because those that need them know where to look to find them. This styling also increases the height of the pagination controls, which pushes the actual tool content further down on the page.

2) The pagination controls appear, at times, aligned left on the page. This interrupts the visual flow of the page, as it again makes the pagination controls as prominent as actual tool content. These should be aligned right whenever possible, so that they're out of the way and consistently located for users to navigate to the ""next"" or ""previous"" page.

The problem I have with the presentation of this screen is that the weight of each item with respect to the *current* calculated course grade varies from student to student throughout the semester based on which items are currently graded and whether any grades are dropped or excluded from the course grade calculation.  

For example:
* All the grades in your screen shot for your students are currently null, so there's just no grade calculated yet.
* If only *Paper1* in your screen shot has a grade entered, it contributes *100%* of the *current* calculated grade.
* If *Paper1* and *Paper2* are graded, each contributes *50%*.

This is simply a display screen that illustrates to instructors that all items have been accounted for and all totals, if every item is completed, will be correctly calculated.

This Jira deals with the issue of having differently weighted items within a weighted category. Currently, this can be done by placing items with different point values in the same category. The items with a greater number of points have a greater weight in the category average calculation. However, instructors may sometimes need to assign different weights to items that are worth the same point value within a category. 

If this feature is added, it would allow instructors to modify the weight of items within a weighted category, regardless of the item point value. 

Since items are weighted differently, the ability to drop/keep the lowest/highest score within a given category would be disabled for that category. 

See attached mockups for one way this option might be added to the UI. (Note: If both this feature and the ""equally weighted"" feature described in SAK-42414 are added, the equal weighting option could simply be the default setting for weighted items within a category, and the check box to indicate equal weighting would not be needed.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SAK-33089,,,,,,,,,"08-Oct-2019 11:06;lgekeler;GradebookCategoriesTreatedDifferently.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/54202/GradebookCategoriesTreatedDifferently.png","20-Sep-2019 11:27;lgekeler;GradebookCategoriesTreatedDifferently.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/54021/GradebookCategoriesTreatedDifferently.png","08-Oct-2019 09:35;ottenhoff;gb2-cat-edit.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/54197/gb2-cat-edit.png","08-Oct-2019 11:41;ottenhoff;gb2-cat-setup.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/54203/gb2-cat-setup.png","08-Oct-2019 09:37;ottenhoff;gb2-item-edit.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/54198/gb2-item-edit.png","09-Oct-2019 10:00;lgekeler;item-weighting-item-details-editable-rev2.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/54209/item-weighting-item-details-editable-rev2.png","20-Sep-2019 09:10;wilma@longsight.com;item-weighting-item-details-editable.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/54019/item-weighting-item-details-editable.png","28-Aug-2019 12:39;wilma@longsight.com;item-weighting-item-details.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/53830/item-weighting-item-details.png","28-Aug-2019 12:39;wilma@longsight.com;item-weighting-setup.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/53832/item-weighting-setup.png","28-Aug-2019 12:39;wilma@longsight.com;item-weighting-spreadsheet-view.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/53831/item-weighting-spreadsheet-view.png","22-Oct-2019 14:09;rainribbon;mockup-overridebox.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/54291/mockup-overridebox.png",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,,,,"0|10by7c:",9223372036854775807,,Please add a Test Plan here.,,,Not started,,,,,,,"04-Sep-2019 09:18;lgekeler;Using a 3rd party tool that assigns the same number of points, this allows different weighting.

Instructors may like to grade everything with 100 pts (essays, etc) but the homeworks get more difficult as the semester goes on. (Illinois, UVa, ND).","13-Sep-2019 10:51;ottenhoff;I believe GB2's interface to ignore the points and use a category percentage was in the Edit Item screen. That seems a lot cleaner as it only requires one additional input box in the Edit Item screen. The mockup that modifies the Settings -> Category screen adds many new inputs and UI complexity.

","13-Sep-2019 13:24;lgekeler;
1) What happens if the instructor wants to add items to the category as they go along? This means weighted items within a category would not necessarily add up to 100%. Why should they?
2) Wouldn't it be better if instructor-entered item weights are subtracted from 100, and the rest of the item weights are evenly distributed among the remaining items? Instructors could then manually override them as they go, but get no warning signs if they choose to let them remain.
3) The mock-up of the edit item screen above has a read only reminder of the weight assigned to the item, even if the category setup screen remains the place where many instructors enter their item weights, (See Sam's comment above), the Edit item screen should not be read-only, but editable. Both places are revised when either one of them gets a new value, and all the other items in the category get revised accordingly (the difference is redistributed equally among all other items in that category.","13-Sep-2019 14:50;rainribbon;If the primary goal of this feature is in fact to allow different weights for same-point-value items in _Assignments_, it seems to me that the editing of these weights has to happen at the item level, on an individual assignment/item basis.  There should also be a place to enter the desired ""override weight"" for the item while creating or editing the assignment.

Furthermore, weights on items should not be restricted to total 100% like weights on categories, because if I explicitly exclude a grade for my student, I don't want other grades to automatically have their scores redistributed such that they are no longer weighted as I wish with respect to one another.

This new ""item weight"" needs to behave essentially the same as the existing _Relative weight_ behaves now in a percent gradebook.  It would define (in this case, override) the total point value of the item within the Gradebook.

The other problem is that calling this new feature _Item Weight_ would introduce additional confusion for instructors who grade in percentages.","17-Sep-2019 13:03;ottenhoff;> Wouldn't it be better if instructor-entered item weights are subtracted from 100, and the rest of the item weights are evenly distributed among the remaining items?

Yes, precisely. This is why I think editing the Category Percentage Override makes sense only in the Edit Item screen and not on the category page. This feature is not asking the user to dole out percentages for each item in a category. This is just an override meant for an item (not for every item in a category).

> Both places are revised when either one of them gets a new value

The category page is fairly light and usable right now. Adding every item underneath the category is going to make that page significantly more complex. This is not a common or normal user feature; it is a true power-user feature and AFAIK, not implemented by any other LMS. I think a minimal modification, to the Edit Item page, is the only place this feature should intrude on. Why greatly complicate the category page if we don't need to?","20-Sep-2019 09:10;wilma@longsight.com;Agreed - Having the item weight editable on the item settings screen would be a more straightforward and simple design. Initially I was thinking users wanted to be able to view and adjust all item weights in a category at once (similar to the way GB category weighting works). However, if the ability to see and edit all of the weights at once is not needed, then placing the option within the item settings makes the most sense. I've made a new mockup showing an editable version of the item details. ","20-Sep-2019 09:23;ottenhoff;Yes, I didn't understand that a user wouldn't edit all percentages until Laura G posted 6 days ago with the three bullet points. 

I don't find ""Item Weight"" intuitive. This new function is saying ""ignore the points entirely and use this category percentage instead"". I believe the word ""override"" should be in the description somewhere and making the override near the points would make this relationship clear. I like ""Category Percentage Override"" but happy to hear other proposals.

Also, are we hiding this functionality by default? Or hiding via a toggle (e.g., ""Override"" toggle or ""Advanced Functionality"" toggle)? It sounds like most people, outside of previous GB2 users, find this behavior confusing.","20-Sep-2019 12:26;wilma@longsight.com;I'm fine with whichever term is most intuitive for end users. Category Percentage Override sounds good to me. 

I would imagine that we want some sort of toggle to enable and disable the feature, since some institutions and/or instructors may not want it. Maybe there could be an ""Allow Category Percentage Overrides for items"" as a check box option in the weighted category setup screen? And perhaps a Sakai property to make that option visible to instructors (in case some institutions want to hide it completely)? ","20-Sep-2019 12:51;rainribbon;I still find Category Percentage Override a bit confusing, because it's not the category percentage you are overriding - it's the item's value with respect to other items within the category.  No matter what percentage you set for each item's override, if you only have one item graded within the category, its current weight within the category will be 100%. 

What about *Override Point Value*?  It could be a check box, where after checking it, a box appears to enter the percentage with some explanatory text like:
{quote}Enter the percentage to weight this item relative to other items within the same category.{quote}","20-Sep-2019 14:11;lgekeler;This title, ""Allow Category Percentage Overrides for items"" calls into question the way the answer is calculated. The Category percentage isn't overridden in the sense that its value is excluded from the calculation, instead, a new calculation is being created 

[category%]*[gradeitem%]=GradeItem%OfTotalGrade

Rather than:

[category%]*[gradeitemPOINTS]=GradeItem%OfTotalGrade

 !GradebookCategoriesTreatedDifferently.png|thumbnail! ","20-Sep-2019 14:18;rainribbon;The new grade item percent you are asking for is in fact an override to the item's point value.  Whether the item is graded in your new override point value or its original point value, the ultimate category average for the student is created by:
# Adding up the total points (or total ""override percentages"") earned by the student to get *points/percentages earned*.
# Adding up the total points (or total ""override percentages"") possible in all *graded items* for the category to get *points/percentage possible*.
# Dividing *points/percentages earned* by *points/percentages possible*.

So for example, let's say there will ultimately be three graded items, each originally worth 100 points, in the category:

Assignment 1 - override grade 20%
Assignment 2 - override grade 20%
Assignment 3 - override grade 60%

A student receives the following grades:

Assignment 1 - 90 points
Assignment 2 - 85 points
Assignment 3 - 95 points

The student's individual item scores, taking into account the Gradebook's point overrides, will be:

Assignment 1 - 90/100 (0.9) x 20 = 18
Assignment 2 - 85/100 (0.85) x 20 = 17
Assignment 3 - 95/100 (0.95) x 60 = 57

Thus, early on in the semester, when only Assignment 1 has its grade entered and included in the course grade, the student's category average is:

18/20 = 90%

A little later on, when Assignment 1 and 2 have their grades entered and included in the course grade, the student's category average is:

(18 + 17) / 40 = 35/40 = 87.5%

Finally, if all three assignments are included in the course grade, the category average is:

(18 + 17 + 57) / 100 = 92/100 = 92%

This override value never counts as a ""percentage"" in the same way that a category percentage functions.  It is just mapping the grade/total points earned from the assignment onto a new point value.

I am concerned about the language used to describe this option because instructors already have trouble understanding how the gradebook calculates grades, and why and how they should be using categories and weighting in the first place.  Without very clear terminology, additional steps in the calculation can easily confuse the instructors more.","20-Sep-2019 15:49;wilma@longsight.com;I've added the UX label to this issue, since I think that group should weigh in on the language used to describe the item weighting/override percentage feature/whatever we call it. Personally, I have no strong preference for a particular term, but I do think that we should use the label that makes the most sense to the majority of our end users.","20-Sep-2019 17:22;ottenhoff;I agree Wilma. Laura, what language are you proposing for this new GBNG feature?","24-Sep-2019 14:12;lgekeler;GB2 had 2 checkboxes:

Here is a GB2 item edit:

The ability to override the Points is simply presented as ""% Category"".

It sounds like we have basic consensus for

1) Only modify this GBNG ""% Category"" setting when editing the item (not on Settings->Category page)

2) Hide the GBNG ""% Category"" with a checkbox

How do we expose the new ""% Category"" input box? With a checkbox that says ""Override Points"" or ""Override Point Value""?

 

 

 

 ","08-Oct-2019 11:06;lgekeler;[~ottenhoff] Regarding the above, yes, I can see I had the label from GB2 wrong. The *_GB Item options_* were labeled:

Weight items equally
Weight items by points

The *_GB Category options_* were on an independent screen and were set first? If categories were chosen, the GB item screen contained the above 2 add'l checkboxes, is that right? And by weighting the individual items with different checkboxes, the scenario represented below could occur, a) a category where an item is weighted within its category as a certain percentage of its category, regardless of its point value (illustrated by the 2 green categories in the screencap below); or b) a category where items are weighted within the category equally by virtue of how many items exist in the category (illustrated by the ""Papers"" category below).

Do I have this correct now?

!gb2-cat-setup.png|thumbnail!

Once Weighted Categories are set in GB2 Gradebook Settings, Category Editing receives two new checkboxes: ""Weight items equally"" and ""Weight items by points"". Choosing ""Weight items by points"" removes the ""Weight items equally"" checkbox. 

Using ""Weight items equally"" on a GB2 category, removes the ability to set ""% Category"" on an item to override points.

> And by weighting the individual items with different checkboxes, the scenario represented below could occur, a) a category where an item is weighted within its category as a certain percentage of its category, regardless of its point value (illustrated by the 2 green categories in the screencap below);

Right, this is overriding/ignoring the points and only using the ""% Category"" setting to determine the portion of the category grade.

> ... or b) a category where items are weighted within the category equally by virtue of how many items exist in the category (illustrated by the ""Papers"" category below).

Yes, this is an equal-weight category (should be set in GBNG on the Categories screen). Note that GB2 did not allow using the item-level ""% Category"" override when a category was set to ""Weight items equally"".","09-Oct-2019 09:15;lgekeler;Instead of the entire GB being identified as a ""categories-style"" gradebook, we have some who would like to apply weighting settings to individual categories. So the Gradebook would use categories or NOT use categories, but each category could then be set to weight by % or by points.

[~wilma@longsight.com] [~ottenhoff]","09-Oct-2019 09:53;lgekeler;When weight by % is selected, any existing GB items receive an initial equal weighting. In GB2 this was ""weight Items Equally"". However, we are proposing the item's relative weight within the category can be changed with this setting because the field containing the initial equal weighting is editable. 
The instructor can then change the percentage of one or more of the items to an arbitrary %.
If no GB items already exist, upon creation of the GB item, an editable field allows the instructor to specify the weight by % value (as well as the point value). 
The End User documentation for Sakai 10 GB2 states, 

{panel:title=Weight by % }
""The Weight Items Equally option allows all graded items to have equal relative weights in the category. In the example above, this box has been checked. The 4 items in the category (paper 1, paper 2, paper 3 and paper 4), is each worth 25% of the category (which is 12.5% of the total Course Grade). If this box is not checked, you will need to set each item's relative weight (i.e., weight relative to other items in the category) manually.""

If this box is checked, the panel display is reset and the ""Drop Lowest"" and ""Weight Equally"" boxes are removed. Weighting by points means that the weight of each item in the category is relative to the maximum point value assigned to it. For instance, if 3 items are listed in the category (paper 1 - 25 points, paper 2 - 50 points and paper 3 - 75 points), then paper 1 is worth 16.66% of the category, paper 2 is worth 33.33% of the category and paper 3 is worth 50% of the category.""

I don't find this intuitive. By setting the category to be item-weighted by percentages, as an instructor I now need to remember that the points value is totally ignored during calculations while needing to make sure that this new Item Weight field is filled out for each item. I can't simply add a new item to this existing category: I need to add the item and then re-weight each existing item. 

You previously mentioned a use case that made good sense to me: instructor has a category with a number of items, and wants one of those items to be worth more than the others. Going to Edit Item Details on the one item, saying ""Override Point Value"" --> ""% Category"" seems a really easy way to accomplish that use case. Why does the instructor need to indicate that the entire category is item-weighted by percentages if the instructor just wants to modify the weight of this one gradebook item?","10-Oct-2019 08:32;rainribbon;Do you have any documentation from Gradebook 2 that *clearly* outlines how this feature worked for an instructor who can barely do basic math?

The description from your Gradebook 2 documentation does not make sense to me, which is why I disagree with the proposed changes.  Instructors already do not understand how the Gradebook calculates grades, and those who use percentage gradebooks tend to calculate them *incorrectly* because they do not understand that each *item weight* must be multiplied by the percentage score for the item before adding up the total points to determine the category average.

I don't like complexity and confusing language that makes it impossible for support staff to understand the calculations.  We need to be able to ensure that the gradebook is calculating correctly and to write *good, clear documentation* for instructors to be able to understand the calculations.","22-Oct-2019 13:47;lgekeler;[~ottenhoff] Here's a real gradebook from the course lead faculty for one of our courses:

I believe Tiffany and I are more or less on the same page: the change should be minimal and should reflect that this is a power-user use case. 

_In GradebookNG as an instructor, in the dropdown menu for an item, select ""Edit Item Details"". From this screen, you can currently manipulate the Point Value. The new feature would allow the instructor to checkbox ""Override Point Value"" which would reveal a new input box. The new input box would be labeled as ""Percentage of Category"" (GB2 labeled it ""% Category""). If a value is entered, the Point Value would become irrelevant while calculating the student's grade._

I'm ready to withdraw ND's sponsorship of returning this feature lost by GB2 users of Sakai upon the adoption of GBNG. I don't want to do it poorly, I want it to be understandable to our faculty (UI, labels, placement). We'd have to be able to simple regression testing of the calculations. We might even want specific testing data to QA with, plenty of variables to cover. I communicated to the course lead for the primary stakeholder here at ND. He is planning to make a case for ND to build out this feature for their course. He has actually been reporting grades in the course this fall by hiding from students the percentage value of the category and showing them rawa grades, which I think is a disservice to their students, but since students are expected to know higher math already, they don't see it that way. Let's pause work on this pending that meeting unless someone besides ND wants to put some skin in the game.","22-Oct-2019 14:03;lgekeler;[~ottenhoff] +1. Simple. Elegant. What about the Gradebook Settings Category screen? The workflow to open each edit details screen is tedious.","22-Oct-2019 14:09;rainribbon;I made a quick mock-up of how I'd imagine the Edit Item screen might look after you enable the point value (or in the case of a percentage GB, item weight) override, showing the box to enter the override grade and a message explaining its usefulness.

I'm sorry.","23-Oct-2019 11:02;rainribbon;The wording was just an example, and should be tweaked.  However, the idea is that a drop lowest/drop highest/keep highest category requires all items to have the same point value.  If you attempt to place a 100-point item in a category where the existing items are worth 10 points, you should get an appropriate error message telling you that you can't and you must adjust the item's point value before placing it there.  The primary use case for overriding point values within the _Gradebook_ is to account for the user's inability to modify point values of items being sent from another tool (such as some LTI tool or _Tests & Quizzes_).

It seems to me that the main issue preventing this jira from moving forward is that you/your instructors want the option on the Gradebook's _Settings_ screen.  The feature proposed in this jira is to modify the values of individual *gradebook items*, so the editing must take place in each individual item's editing screen, because that is where point values (a.k.a. ""item weights"" in a percentage gradebook) are edited.

I think your instructors are hung up on some (in my opinion, confusing) language that GB2 used.  The Gradebook _Settings_ in a gradebook with categories and weighting are not involved in the point calculations within a category; the category weights come into play in the grade calculation *after* a category average is established.","07-Nov-2019 08:23;lcira;Thanks [~ottenhoff], [~lgekeler], [~rainribbon] and [~wilma@longsight.com] for commenting and working on this.

However, the issue here is that we are still missing the screen we used in GB2 to display all the items in a category and their relative weights towards the final grade (see GradebookCategoriesTreatedDifferently.png) which helped give faculty a better understanding of where they were in their grade calculations. This is a valuable resource when setting up your gradebook and one that faculty referenced constantly to make sure they had included all their grade items and that everything was being calculated correctly. (See https://jira.sakaiproject.org/browse/SAK-33856).  If we could figure out a way/location to present that simple list of details, the solution suggested in this ticket would work. 

Without that screen, however, this will be a little harder to manage for our users as they jump from grade item to grade item adjusting scores and hoping they've got the math right without a single screen to help them know. Remember that Gradebooks and student scores are viewed as a big vulnerability to faculty. There are a lot of things they're willing to not do well in Sakai, but entering and calculating grades isn't one of them.

If SAK-42046 doesn't fully capture the info you think should be displayed, a comment on that JIRA would be helpful.

> hoping they've got the math right without a single screen to help them know.

Even with the single screen, this feature adds complexity to the grading calculations with an implied if/else statement (if override is present, use that multiplier; else use the points). If the argument is that grading calculations increase faculty vulnerability, this may be why other LMSes stay away from this level of complexity.",,,,,,

The Kernel dependency will have to be resolved first. As suggested by [~jonespm], a possible solution would be to integrate ETS into Kernel:

I think ETS, (at least the service part) is a solid way of doing translations for emails.

Please keep in mind:
* _Item Order_ is not an intuitive place to go looking for percentages.
* Each gradebook item in the reorder list can't be split up into multiple cells of a data table because the list items need to be able to be dragged/dropped.
* Screen reader users would have no reference, reading left to right, of what ""heading"" should be associated with each ""column"" of information. Basically, a screen reader user would be listening to random percentages in between each item title and the buttons they need to use to move that item up or down.  This would be distracting and make it harder for them to complete the primary task they would expect to find after accessing an _Item Order_ screen, i.e., reordering items.","07-Nov-2019 13:42;lcira;I agree [~rainribbon], I think this location for the total grade display is most likely not the best location.

The other concern I have is that this desired feature may require Gradebook to make new calculations.  If the code is not already there to produce these % values, it will need to be developed before they can display.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think the issue of quick access to items in the lessons menus would be more appropriately remedied by:
# Dividing the groupings of items into smaller, more logical groups (such as putting the three ""Embed"" options for Calendar, Announcements, and Forums widgets in a separate group than the options to generate links).
# Introducing a proper heading structure for each grouping of menu items, e.g., *Add Content*, *Create Links*, *Embed Content*, etc., to enable navigation via headings for those who use heading link lists to navigate.
# Putting the options in an actual *menu* where you can start typing the first characters of an option to skip down to its link.

But the wording of this feature is very confusing.

The first checkbox to enable the feature reads: ""Posts are anonymous, but identities will be revealed to those with the Identify Anonymous Authors permission below. Note: Roles with Owner Permissions can view identities by default.""

There are two points of confusion here with this wording:
 # It's not clear that the ""Identify Anonymous Authors Permission Below"" is actually referring to the *second* *checkbox* that gets revealed upon clicking this first checkbox (i.e. ""Reveal identities to roles with the 'Identify Anonymous Authors' permission below""), and is actually +_not_+ specifically referring to the ""Identify Anonymous Authors"" Permission Items on the Permission-by-role table at the bottom of the page. 
 # The last 'note' (i.e. ""Note: Roles with Owner Permission can view Identities by Default"") is confusing when trying to square it with the second, revealed checkbox. If its granted by default, then instructors may wonder why they are being confronted with another checkbox prompting them to allow roles who already have default permission to view identities. 

 

Instructors will not understand all this confusing language and so better wording is needed.

What's really happening here is that the second checkbox (i.e. ""Reveal identities to roles with the 'Identify Anonymous Authors' permission below"") seems to be serving as a final, transparent check in getting the instructor to be very deliberate about revealing identities to those who already possess the ""Identify Anonymous Authors"" permission in the permission-by-role table at the bottom of the page. 

While I propose the following, I am completely open to ideas from others:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

First checkbox: Posts are anonymous.

Second checkbox: Confirm your desire to reveal identities to roles possessing the ""Identify Anonymous Authors"" permission item in the Permissions-by-Role table below.

","19-Feb-2019 10:30;lcira;Bringing this back into the discussion around the Gradebook. We continually get asked when we will offer this feature again as many, many instructors built their gradebooks on this functionality over the last few years. This feature not only allowed items with the same point values to be weighted differently within a weighted category, but items with different point values to be weighted identically within a weighted category.","11-Jul-2019 10:03;lgekeler;Is the workaround to assign different point values to items in the same category or is that not allowed?","11-Jul-2019 10:56;raulsv;Hi [~lgekeler]

Yes, the workaround is allowed but it is not enough because many instructors used to create items with the same points values and weighted differently within a weighted category or creating items with the same weight and different points within a weighted category.","16-Aug-2019 08:28;wilma@longsight.com;See attached mockups for an idea of how this might look in the current Gradebook. Feedback is also requested from the community on the next T&L call.

 ","16-Aug-2019 14:01;lcira;I think we're getting there @Wilma. There are two parts to the item weighing that faculty utilized a lot in GB2: Weighing all items in a single category the same regardless of their actual point value; and assigning different weight values to items with the SAME point value in a same category. 

This is how the GB2 allowed this decision:

 !screenshot-2.png|thumbnail! 

","16-Aug-2019 14:36;wilma@longsight.com;I'm not sure I understand the difference between ""weight items by points"" and what the Gradebook does now in a weighted category without weighted items. Isn't it already assigning items a greater percentage of the category if they are worth more points? [~lcira] - can you explain how this is different?

The other option, ""weight items equally"" does make sense to me. I was actually thinking that the default behavior when a user selects Item Weighting within a category is to list all items within the category starting at an equal weight. Then, if desired, the user could adjust the weighting if needed. Do you think that making equal weighting the default is sufficient, or would users need/prefer an additional option/selection for this? I was trying to avoid cluttering the UI with too many choices, but we can certainly add it if it is needed. 

 

 ","22-Aug-2019 07:55;wilma@longsight.com;T&L discussed this Jira on 8/21/19 and the general consensus was that this feature is something the community wants. In addition, the proposed UI mockups seemed to satisfy the desired functionality. It was agreed that ""weight item by points"" is the behavior that we currently have now, so we don""t need a separate option for that. For the ""weight items equally"" option, the following provisions should be in place:
 * The default behavior when an instructor selects the ""Item Weight"" option for a category is to automatically weight all items within that category equally. 
 * If a new item is added to a category with item weighting enabled, the weight of the existing items in that category should automatically be adjusted so that all items are weighted equally (i.e. the default). 

Note: After some discussion with our devs, it was determined that having variable weights within weighted categories can be accomplished now, with existing functionality, using item points. Adding the ability to also adjust item weights with percentages would be redundant and rather complicated. Therefore, we propose to keep the ""equal weighting"" option only. This should be a simpler and less confusing approach.","22-Aug-2019 09:07;wilma@longsight.com;Since the new option to weight items equally has been simplified, I've updated the proposed mockups. 

Gradebook Settings no longer needs fields for viewing/editing item weights, so I've changed that column to a check box instead. Also I've labeled it ""Weight Items Equally"" to more clearly indicate the intended behavior.

Additionally, the individual item edit screen would not need to direct users to modify item weight, since it will always default to equally weighted.","22-Aug-2019 10:36;lcira;[~wilma@longsight.com] In response to:  ""Note: After some discussion with our devs, it was determined that having variable weights within weighted categories can be accomplished now, with existing functionality, using item points.

This is not a solution for most of our instructors. In many cases, they are placing items in a common category with the *same point values* (say homework scores being collected from outside Sakai) but which need to be weighted differently. The only way to accomplish this is to be able to choose weighted items in a weighted category (as they've done with GB2 for years) and tell the Gradebook what weight value those items will contribute.","22-Aug-2019 11:15;lgekeler;Use Case 1:
Instructor uses external homework system which gives each homework the same point value ""10"". The Instructor exports from that system and imports into Sakai. The Instructor wants to give more weight to later homework because it ranks up in complexity even though the homework system doesn't allow points to be changed. Homework itself is worth 25% of the total course grade.

Use Case 2: Instructor creates a weighted category for her 3 part project. The entire project is worth 30% of the course grade. The instructor believes students understand 100 pts, and these points are divided among rubric items for each of the 3 assignments of the total project. However, the instructor wishes to make the point that the research and development sections take more effort if the final product is to be exemplary by making the first 2 parts of the project weighted more than the final assignment/product.","22-Aug-2019 14:10;ottenhoff;I would like to see equal-weight categories implemented.

What worries me about ""same point values ... which need to be weighted differently"" in one weighted category? It seems like a proposal for another layer of complexity that will surely lead to more support and more questions about grading calculations. Questions from faculty are fairly common with simple weighted categories and drop highest/lowest, my instinct is that another layer of weighting is going to increase questions further. 

I attempted to replicate this in an old GB2 instance -but could not figure out how to weight an item differently inside a weighted category (while keeping points at 100). Can someone show how this was done?- I finally figured it out in GB2. They have a category where the points are ignored and you assign a new percentage to each item. This seems like a big jump from a code perspective, and I would encourage moving it to a separate JIRA. I don't find the secondary weighting intuitive, but of course, I defer to the community for thoughts on what is most important to implement.

 !gb2.png|thumbnail! ","22-Aug-2019 14:27;rainribbon;I agree that it would be confusing to have separately weighted items within weighted categories.  As others have already mentioned, if you use different numbers of points for the items, items worth more points contribute more points to the category percentage.

If you use a *percentage* gradebook, you already have to *weight* each item (set its point value).  This can create confusion for instructors because item weights are different from category weights.  It sounds like [Use Case 2 mentioned in Laura's comment above|https://jira.sakaiproject.org/browse/SAK-33089?focusedCommentId=244921&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-244921] would be better handled by simply using a percentage _Gradebook_.

I think Use Case 1 could be handled in a less confusing way by simply reorganizing the items into separate categories, one which is weighted more than the other.  So for example, the early (easy) assignments might be 10% of the course grade and later (difficult) assignments 15%.

The suggested implementation also poses an additional problem of *drop/keep categories*.  The system will need to know that you can't drop/keep grades in a category where items of equal point value also have different weights.

If this feature is implemented, *please please* make its availability controlled with a *Sakai property* to *disable it easily*.  There are enough instructors who have trouble understanding the existing calculations with categories and weighting!","22-Aug-2019 15:06;lgekeler;[~rainribbon] about ""It sounds like Use Case 2 mentioned in Laura's comment above would be better handled by simply using a percentage Gradebook."" yeah, but no one who uses assignments can do this.","22-Aug-2019 15:12;lgekeler;*GB2 users have wanted this feature back from the day GBNG came out. *Notre Dame is bringing this feature request back into the spotlight after hearing from a cadre of instructors and their tas who teach 500 students in a single course site. Here's what they scripted and each of them turned in to our enhancement request google form... I have a problem with their alternate solution in that they are basically saying they will use the Gradebook to post grades but not to calculate grades. They'll turn off the display of final grade and category weights. 

I coordinate the EG10111/EG10112 courses, which contain about 500 students each semester. 

The courses feature weighted categories within weighted categories. For example, the EG10112 project is 20% of the final EG10112 course average, but components of the project have different weights (demonstration day is worth 25%, the video report worth 20%, etc.). For ease of grading, each component is graded out of 100 points, allowing instructors to assess the performance of the students with appropriate gradation (and avoiding fractions of a point, etc.). However, you cannot have weighted categories within weighted categories in Sakai. This means that when entered in Sakai, the different components have equal weights rather than the different weights associated with the project. This results in inaccurate category averages on Sakai. This was true for both our project category and final exam category this semester. This limitation in the Sakai platform is compounded by the inability to hide category averages (you can hide the overall grade, but you can not hide the category average). 

With 65 grades for 500 students in our Gradebook in the spring of 2018, we need to use categories in order to organize the Gradebook effectively. However, doing so resulted in our class displaying incorrect category averages that students used to predict their final course grade (despite a warning against doing so in the course syllabus). An instructor shouldn't have to decide between making a Gradebook less organized (thereby making it more difficult to use the Gradebook) and showing incorrect category averages (thereby confusing the students). 

The learning management system should allow myself and the instructor team to be more efficient in the administrative components of the course so we can spend more time on curriculum development and actually teaching. Instead, we received over a dozen emails regarding this confusion over final grades. We had to send a course-wide email explaining the situation to all students in order to avoid further confusion. Not only does this have poor optics on the course organization (and Sakai), but this confusion unnecessarily consumed instructor and student time.

I hope you can find an efficient solution for the instructors (i.e., a solution other than not categorizing any grades or making individual categories for each weighted category within a weighted category). The easiest solution (other than weighted categories within weight categories) is to have an option to hide category averages. 
","22-Aug-2019 15:20;rainribbon;[~lgekeler] I don't understand why they can't make the assignment point value 20?  When they enter appropriate grades in _Assignments_, it will display a value out of 100% for students in _Gradebook_, and be weighted appropriately 20% of the category (assuming other item weights add up to 80).

 !assignmentweighted.png|thumbnail! 

 !assignmentgrading.png|thumbnail! 

Here's weighting with different assignment components described in your letter above:

 !assignment-described.png|thumbnail! 

It sounds like the real blocker here is that the instructors refuse to enter grades out of 20 or 25 points instead of out of 100.

If that's the problem, then I'd recommend using Excel to convert 100 point grades to 20 or 25, then import the grades from the spreadsheet to _Assignments_ using *Upload All* and selecting the *grades.xls* or *grades.csv* option.","23-Aug-2019 14:41;rainribbon;[~lgekeler] If the instructors are adamant about entering the grades out of 100%, they can also accomplish this by using the option in _Assignments_ *associate with existing gradebook item*.  Here's how it works:

# Set up _Gradebook_ with *percentages* and create categories with appropriate weights.
# Create gradebook items, with the appropriate weights, in the appropriate categories.
# In _Assignments_, create assignments with point values corresponding to those weights, and associate the assignments to the weighted items.
# Enter the grades (out of 100%) in _Gradebook_.

# Go to _Assignments_, *Grade* the associated assignment, *Release Grades*.

If it's going to replace the tabs, my concern is that menus with symbols/icons and no text can be problematic for some users with cognitive disabilities.

We had an instructor specifically request such a button for _Resources_ because each semester, he just wants to import all resources from his previous semester's site.

The one concern I have is that if it only brings in content from a specific tool at a time, links to that content in other tools (e.g., _Lessons_, _Assignments_, Samigo if images are embedded in test questions, etc.) will not migrate to point to the imported content in the current site.  The import process would need to automatically identify which other tools had linked content in the original site and select them by default, with the user able to deselect those additional tools (if they don't care about links failing to migrate).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We contrasted his mockup with the ""Message Center Notifications"" synoptic tool for Messages and Forums that displays a summary of new messages on the Overview page. We all agreed that each chat room should be listed in this table with a link to the room and the number of unread messages (if possible to determine). This probably needs its own Jira feature request created. 

From a technical perspective, additional functionality might be needed to record the last-access time of the user to each chat room and comparing that to the current time and how many messages have come in since. Deep-linking to a particular chat room

We proposed deprecating the current ""Recent Chat Messages"" synoptic tool and turning it off by default (maybe available to enable via the Manage Overview page, if someone wants) once Chat has been added to the Message Center Notifications.

*Messages from multiple chat rooms are intermixed without discrimination*

Messages could use improved grouping for display as they are not displayed according to their respective chat rooms, definitely an improvement should create a Jira for it.

*Messages are organized chronologically with the newest at the top, making it difficult to follow the thread of conversation*

Message should be in chronological order with the newest at the bottom vs the top, maybe this should be configurable? good suggestion create a JIRA

*Chat room, user name, date and time are all on one line underneath the message itself, making it difficult to tell who is typing and where.*

This probably requires some research to find out what is the best approach at displaying this part of the ui, good observation please create new Jira for this issue.

*Options button does not affect the tool at all(12.6)*

This is possibly a bug that has already been fixed so no need to even mention this here but better to find what issue fixed it?

The UI would just be limited, I think.

I think it would make a lot more sense to think in terms of either an extra bulhorn type icon, the chat icon, which we could then populate with a richer UI to replace the synoptic tool entirely.

I like this idea! I'm not too terribly concerned with it being a drop-down. I think a property table like you've outlined would work just fine. In addition, your idea adds more flexibility to filter across additional properties (other than just term), which I think is a good idea. ","01-Sep-2019 18:28;jonespm;The only way I might *slightly* improve it is to make the *values* an alphabetized drop down field, and select from all available properties in this table.

I'd probably want to check the performance (and count) of that query on a few larger installations before doing it though.

Lessons and Overview -- Reduce excessive white space to improve academic content real estate,SAK-40134,83378,New Feature,OPEN,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project. Please follow the <a href=""https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/MGT/Sakai+Jira+Guidelines"">Jira Guidelines</a>",http://sakaiproject.org,Major,,maintenanceteam,alanregan,alanregan,13-Jun-2018 13:18,28-Aug-2019 17:02,18-Feb-2021 03:39,,11.5 [Tentative],12.2,19.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Home,Lessons,,,,,,4,LSClient,TL,UX,,,,,,"h1. REQUEST:

Modify the CSS within the Lessons and Overview (formerly ""Home"") tools to reduce excess white space.
h1. BACKGROUND:

As a learning platform, our academic content must be in the forefront. Currently, there is too much unnecessary white space (margins and padding) that steals valuable teaching real estate on the page. A certain amount of margins or padding is necessary to separate elements, such as the left tool menu or the top header. However, there is a little extra white space on the Overview tool (when you use a heading) and there is an overly excessive amount of white space in Lessons regardless of the content on the page.  This white space pushes content lower on the page, forcing users to scroll down to find information.  It can also frustrate instructional designers that want to make the most of the available screen real estate.
h2. OVERVIEW TOOL

There is only a little extra white space in the Overview tool (formerly the Home tool). If the opening content on the page is a heading, additional top margin or padding is added. This is not a critical item, but some space could be gained here.

Here is a screenshot of space that could be recovered in the student view of the Overview tool:

!overview-whitespace-compare.png|thumbnail!

For the above, the change made:
 * *h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6*: changed ""margin: 0.75em 0 0.5em 0;"" to ""margin: 0 0 0.5em 0;"" in _defaults.scss

NOTE: I simply used the ""Inspect Element"" in Google Chrome to modify the CSS. A thorough review of how these changes may impact other tools should be done. If necessary, adjustments should be done to provide appropriate spacing in Overview but not negatively impact other tools.
h2. LESSONS TOOL

The Lessons tool is awesome. It provides great functionality to add content, link to activities, embed media, and much more. The tool eats up screen space, however. This is especially evident in the student or access view of a page. There is unnecessary top padding or margins that produce too much white space on Lessons pages. We should eliminate as much of this wasted space as possible to maximize the content we can display for our users on desktop and mobile views.

Here is a screenshot of space that could be recovered in the student view of Lessons:

!lessons-whitespace-compare.png|thumbnail!

For the above, the changes made included:
 * *.right-col:* removed ""padding-top: 3px;"" in Simplepagetool.css?version=1528d2fe
 * *.cols1:* removed ""padding-top: 35px;"" in Simplepagetool.css?version=1528d2fe
 * *.column:* removed ""padding: 15px 7px;"" in Simplepagetool.css?version=1528d2fe
 * *.column:* removed ""padding-top: 25px;"" in Simplepagetool.css?version=1528d2fe
 * *h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6*: changed ""margin: 0.75em 0 0.5em 0;"" to ""margin: 0 0 0.5em 0;"" in _defaults.scss
 * *.itemclass*: changed ""margin-top: 2.0em !important;"" to ""margin-top: 0 !important;"" in Simplepagetool.css?version=1528d2fe
 * (I did not change .mainList div.textType, .mainList div.multimediaType, .mainList div.checklistType in Simplepagetool.css?version=1528d2fe. There are margins here that could also be adjusted, but they seemed to be okay or helpful so I didn't adjust them.)

NOTE: I simply used the ""Inspect Element"" in Google Chrome to modify the CSS. A thorough review of how these changes may impact other tools should be done. If necessary, adjustments should be done to provide appropriate spacing in Lessons but not negatively impact other tools.

I appreciate the additional perspective you provided.","15-Jun-2018 14:29;alanregan;The CSS I listed helps the student view of the content.

The *.itemclass* element impacts the instructor view. It provides the spacing between the ""Add Content"" bar and the first section of content.  It would be good if elements of the instructor interface don't negatively impact the student view. While the instructor tools don't display to the students, it seems like the Lessons layout preserves that space... and thus adds more white space to the page in the student view. Hopefully a creative solution can allow the tools to display properly for instructors and the content to display properly for students.","27-Aug-2019 19:22;alanregan;[~sfoster9] - is this an item the UX group might review?

I don't know if there would be a cascade effect of changes to the CSS in Lessons on other tools (if a tweak to reduce whitespace in Lessons might trip up another area of Sakai).  So ""grain of salt"" the CSS items I listed in the original ticket.  Also, I think the code was from Sakai 11 at the time... so ""baggage in the overhead bins may have shifted in flight."" :)

"Removing ""Re-use content"" option to unify and optimize content import workflow for new sites",SAK-42356,86038,New Feature,OPEN,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project. Please follow the <a href=""https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/MGT/Sakai+Jira+Guidelines"">Jira Guidelines</a>",http://sakaiproject.org,Major,,maintenanceteam,wilma@longsight.com,wilma@longsight.com,16-Aug-2019 12:16,19-Aug-2019 14:25,18-Feb-2021 03:39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Site Info,Worksite Setup,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,"Currently in Sakai, there are several different methods for copying/importing content into new sites. The ""Re-use content from existing sites"" option within the site creation workflow is not heavily used, and is both confusing and buggy. I propose removing that option from the site creation workflow completely and replacing it with a more streamlined workflow to use the Import from Site method of copying instead.

Import from Site is a much more thoroughly tested and robust process, and there are some additional enhancements planned for this process, such as more granular selection of individual items, the ability to choose published status, etc. In order to take advantage of these improvements, the ""create site"" workflow needs to use the Import from Site service. This also has the added benefit of making the site import/copy process more consistent across the system.

If this change is implemented, the option to ""Re-use content"" which currently appears near the end of the site creation workflow would not display. Instead, users would continue through the site creation process to the end. Then, immediately upon clicking the ""Request Site"" button, the user would be prompted to indicate if they would like to import content from existing sites into the new site. If the user answers ""Yes"" then they are immediately taken into the new site and directly to the Site Import screen to select the content to be copied. 

Additionally, it would be useful if Sakai could automatically detect an instructor's first login to a site and ask the user if they would like to import content at that point as well. Selecting ""Yes"" would take the user directly into the Import from Site workflow as above. However, the first login auto-detect option would benefit institutions who create sites automatically, rather than faculty creating their own sites manually. This feature could have a property associated with it so that institutions could choose to enable or disable it as desired.

For instance if you have
 * Category 1 (50%)
 ** Sub Category 1 (75%)
 ** Sub Category 2 (25%)

 

It seems the same as
 * Category 1 - Sub Category 1 (50% * 25%)

This would be very useful in a *self-paced course*. Please find a quick mock-up of this feature attached below.

For example: Assume a student must go through several required components in several modules within the Lessons tool. The student must submit a required assignment before proceeding to the required quiz before proceeding to the next required module. 

The student submits the required assignment, which then unlocks the quiz. The student then takes and submits the quiz. But before the student is allowed to go on to the next module (i.e. before the next module is unlocked/released), the student must wait an interval amount of time (say, 24 hours) before proceeding. 

In a course that is +_not_+ self-paced, this is not an issue. The instructor can simply set the the next module to ""unhide"" on a specific date and time, however this forces all students to obey the same timeline. 

In a self-paced course, there may be a desire by the instructor to facilitate the learning experience by preventing the student from rushing through a self-paced course as fast as he/she can. 

This way, an instructor does not have to specify strict dates and times for students to meet the granular milestones throughout the course. 

There would need to be a way to make exceptions as well on a student-by-student basis. For example, a student could wait until the last minute (say, 12 hours before the course must be completed) to go through two modules. If there is a ""24 hour"" wait rule between the two modules, then the student wouldn't be able to complete both modules before the deadline. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"04-Jun-2019 13:42;jbuckin2;2019-06-04_11-30-56.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/52995/2019-06-04_11-30-56.png",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,,,,"0|10buts:",9223372036854775807,,Please add a Test Plan here.,,,Not started,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Technically the column break is an item. Next only goes to a new page if it's the next item. Basically next works as long as the next item is one that shows in a separate window. If the next item displays inline on the main page, we have to go back to the main page to let you see it. But in this case the next item isnt one that will show in a window, because it's a column break. So next will work as you expect within a column, but treats columns as separate.

You could argue for either behavior, depending upon how people use columns. It would be easy enough to ignore break items when looking for next. I'll think about it.","12-Jul-2016 10:18;fawei;Thanks for your quick response Charles.  

If somehow it makes clearer that each colum is an entity between the parent page and subpages, it is ok as it currently works.  However, as it currently stands, the system treats all subpages in as one big pool instead of sub-pool based on the column - see attached screenshot, I guess that it makes sense to not go on to the next subpage rather than the parent page.

We did originally have an alert for resources, but after we used it amongst ourselves for a while we felt is was more annoying than useful. One of the problems is what was called out: there's no easy way to group notifications after they occur. More broadly, however, why would the instructor necessarily want to call attention to new resources? Wouldn't s/he make an announcement if there's something the students should do?

I'll make a PR next week","15-May-2019 14:51;rainribbon;Assuming *content.available* triggers a bullhorn notification, I'm concerned about the implementation of resources notifications as far as permissions go.  For example, what will happen in the following situations?

# Instructor creates a folder that is *hidden with contents visible* where they upload quiz images.  Because students have permission to access the images, in theory the bullhorns would notify the students of the upload and provide them the links to those images.  But it shouldn't because the intent of the folder functionality is to provide access only when the instructor intends it.
# Instructor hides the _Resources_ tool in their site and uploads some files. Similar to #1, the students should not be notified of these files being uploaded.
# Instructor uploads some files, then sets the files or a containing folder to only be accessed at a particular date.  Are students notified of the upload, provided the links in the bullhorns, and then just get an access error when trying to access the file via the bullhorn link?  I would want the bullhorn to only notify students on the date when the resource becomes available to them, but since the upload happens prior to the date specification, I suspect students would receive notifications first.","21-May-2019 06:23;_Z_;You mention some very good points.

ad 1. Bullhorn should recognize if a resource or collection is *hidden, but allows access*. I'm currently testing this feature in my implementation.

ad 2. If the Resources tool is hidden, it will still allows access if the students have the correct URL. I think the solution is that the instructor hides the root folder instead of the tool.

ad 3. It would be necessary to delete bullhorn notification, but I'm a little bit concerned on the performance implication   ","21-May-2019 07:55;a.fish@lancaster.ac.uk;Cleaning up on subsequent events happens in a couple of places already - it's not a problem. The main issue around resources is handling the potential deluge - preferences need sorting before we add resources, imo. The grouping of alerts will help, but still, a user should be able to control bullhorns with preferences.","21-May-2019 08:48;rainribbon;[~_Z_] in Sakai 12+, the Resources tool being hidden also makes the root folder ""hidden with access allowed to contents"" (prior to Sakai 12+, it was not possible to set that property on the root folder).  Note that the problem with this is that links to the contents of these hidden folders also show up in *Search* (assuming the student knows what file names to search for) and it sounds like links to the contents of the hidden folders will now show up in Bullhorns, too, presenting the students with a nice alert: ""Hey, look, Prof. X just uploaded all the images that will be used in your quiz a month from now - go check them out!""

Unless the instructor knows to date-restrict the folders (and they would have to make sure to edit every folder for every course if they reuse materials), all the content will be accessible by students at times when the instructor doesn't want it available.  Furthermore, if a file is uploaded and then edited to implement the date restriction, the student would be alerted of the file's presence before they should even know it exists.

I think because features like *folder hidden with contents visible* were created to address a need for instructors to have content only available to students via links *the instructors provide at specific times*, we should not make changes that essentially nullify the effects of the features.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"When creating groups, have filters to display only students from specific section/roster and students not yet assigned to existing group",SAK-32598,71228,New Feature,OPEN,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project.

Use case: Site has 5 discussion sections, each section with 20 students.  The instructor wants to manually create small groups within each discussion section, but not accidentally put the same student in more than one group.

Two drop-down filtering options are proposed for views:
 # View Section/roster vs. Entire Site
 # Out of #1, view only students who have not yet been added to a group

Along these lines, for large sites, it would be helpful to search/filter by student name.

Example mock-up showing drop-downs based on the Gradebook drop-downs.  Note that instead of seeing the rosters at the top of the Site Member List, you'd only see roles and participants within that section.

!filtermockup.png|thumbnail!

 
----
It would take away tremendouw administraitve effort for faculty and reduce the potential for errors when students are assigned to / may join sections if nesting (parent-child) of sections was possible.

An example:
 We have one course site for every course taught during one block (10 weeks) at Hotelschool The Hague. 
 The course site has multiple section categories:
 * Location (in order to designate faculty Amsterdam and faculty The Hague)
 * Workshop Group (within one faculty multiple workshop groups / cohorts exist)
 * Project Team (within one workshop group, multiple project teams exist)

When assigning students to the course sites, faculty have to add manually the students from the smallest granularity (project teams) on a team by team basis, then once all teams of one workshop group have been added immediately add them to the respective workshop group, before adding other teams. Once all workshop groups for one location have been added, the students must be assigned to the respective location, before you can do this entire cycle again for the other location. This is prone to errors to be made.

If they would not do it this way, for every lower-level section, you have to assign the students from the all-encompassing list of 'unassigned students' within the every section category.

Students of one workshop group may join teams consisting of up to 5 students per team. The teams however must be formed within their own workshop group.

Please see below the visual flow of this procedure taken from an example course worksite. The screenshots have been taken in a demo course site.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"07-Jun-2018 09:33;rainribbon;filtermockup.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/50012/filtermockup.png","09-Jun-2017 08:51;toncotijdeman;image.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/47519/image.png","09-Jun-2017 08:48;toncotijdeman;image.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/47520/image.png",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,,,,"0|109hx4:",9223372036854775807,,,,,Not started,,,,,,,"07-Jun-2018 08:57;rainribbon;In the mock-up, I especially like the drop-down to filter ""Unassigned Students"".  Currently, it's very hard when manually assigning groups to remember who has been added to one already.

[~toncotijdeman] Would it completely solve the use case to simply add that drop-down and be able to select a course section/roster to filter from it?  So when I am creating groups in a site with two rosters/sections, all I have to do is filter by my section and I can title the groups appropriately so I know which goes with which section?

If there is a flag or setting under the hood, please add a note in comments with the details for an institution interested in this feature and we'll close this ticket! :)
h1. OVERVIEW:

We have received requests of allowing a list of all assignments (whether open or not) to help students plan their course work. While many professors may also list these items in separate documents, like the syllabus, the goal would be to leverage the existing tool to provide a full listing of assignments and dates for students – at the choice/discretion of the professor.

We certainly see the one side of not overwhelming students by a long list of assignments (and rolling out in stages with the open date). At the same time, there are some professors or course offerings (such as self-paced offerings) where a full disclosure model can be very valuable to students.
h1. FEATURE REQUEST:

Add a checkbox when adding an assignment to enable a professor to display the title, open date, and due date BEFORE the open date. This way, students can see the entire list of assignments required in a course, listed chronologically. The assignments that are not ""open"" yet will not have links (they can't view details or submit content). The listing will provide the big picture of all assignment work ahead of them. Assignments with open dates would work as normal.

Thank you for considering this feature request.

In some teaching approaches displaying all of the assignments from the start can be beneficial.

To help visualize the request, I mocked up two quick images and added them to the description.

The setting language I proposed was ""Display the assignment title, open, and due dates to students before the open date.""  I'm sure someone will think up a better way to say this.  ""Show all assignments even before open date"" or ""List all assignment titles, open, and due dates"" or something else. Very open to the best language to help this feature request proceed.

[~jtingen] mentioned that Duke had contributed a Visible Date option for Assignments in SAK-22282 that can be enabled with a sakai.property to provide instructors with the option to make the assignment visible before students can submit.

# This feature is driven by a need for us to show students upcoming tasks but not allow them to act on them until the open date. 
# DEFAULT: false (disabled)
# assignment.visible.date.enabled=true
{code}","25-Apr-2019 10:32;alanregan;Thanks, [~sfoster9] and [~jtingen]. The visible date feature is definitely a step in the right direction!  I like the approach very much since it meets the requirements of displaying the assignments in the list before the open date.  However, it offers too much access.  The intent of the original request was to simply show the assignment in the table with the name and dates, but not make the link to get details on the assignment active. This way, students can't see the description or attachments, just have it on the radar for planning purposes.

Related to the user interface, I would likely run the language through some usability testing with faculty. My gut says that ""Visible Date,"" while accurate, doesn't explain the feature quickly. Perhaps make the initial label more obvious, like ""Display assignment before open date"" or ""Use Visible Date option to display the assignment before the open date"" or the like. Else, there would likely need to be a question mark icon with an explanation of what the ""Visible Date"" feature does. 

I like the use of the date picker to be specific. I wish the date was set to the current date/time rather than time in the future. If someone wants it immediately viewable it would save instructors the time of changing the timing.

Perhaps to meet the requirements of withholding the details, an additional checkbox can be added that makes the link to the assignment details active or inactive.  Imagine a checkbox that says something like ""Allow students to view assignment details before open date"" or the like.  If not checked, the title of the assignment is not a link to the details. If checked, the title is clickable as it is in the current configuration.

With the multiple selection drop-down, after I selected options and navigated away from the menu with a keyboard, I had a lot of difficulty tabbing back into the area with the selected options and removing selected items.  I also couldn't figure out how to remove a specific selected item nearer the front of the list to delete that one, without first deleting all later selections.","26-Feb-2019 08:05;rainribbon;In a conversation on the International Association of Accessibility Professionals mailing list where folks were discussing accessibility issues with selection menus, Brian Osborne raised the following concerns:

{quote}
Hi Tiffany - The multi select you linked too works really well with a keyboard, but doesn't work well with a screen reader. I tested it using Mac's VoiceOver application and there were a few problems I noticed:

When the select field receives focus, it's announced that I'm on a text field. But there's no indication that there's select options available to choose from. A non-sighted user would have no way of knowing they could use their keyboard to select various options.
When using arrow keys to select the various options in the drop down, the option that has focus is not announced. So a non-sighted user would not know what option they were selecting.
The selected options are not announced when the field receives focus, so a non-sighted user cannot review their selections. Individual items can be focused by using the arrow keys, but they are not announced. A non-sighted user would not know how to remove items or which one they are removing.

I have asked [~rmmcget] if his testers can determine whether the proposed menu will be a problem for screen reader users.","07-Mar-2019 16:11;rainribbon;I was just thinking, if [~rmmcget]'s team determines that it may not be possible to make a screen-reader accessible multi-select option on the *Export* page, what about making the Export obey the instructor's currently selected Gradebook display?

What I mean is, if the instructor selects a roster/group on the Gradebook main page to filter, and then goes to Export, the students included in the export are automatically those from the roster/group presently being displayed.  That was how the Export option worked in Gradebook Classic - you went to the All Grades page, selected the roster/group from the View drop-down menu, and then clicked Export.","28-Mar-2019 11:18;rainribbon;The information on the following page may also be helpful: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#combobox","28-Mar-2019 13:32;kedwar1;[~rainribbon]

a) nobody knows that the actual *Sites * button will open something called a Sites _Drawer_. That term may not be the most intuitive.

These options and more already exist within the Tests & Quizzes tool. Rather than recreating existing test functionality within Lessons, I'd like to propose that we add the option to display a Samigo assessment in-line on a Lessons page. This would allow users to leverage the existing capabilities of Samigo and still have the in-line display within the Lessons area.

 * timer bar
 * question progress box
 * multiple questions per page
 * table of contents
 * immediate feedback to be displayed during quiz take

3). Provision made for conditional release of subsequent items based on getting a minimum # of points on the quiz (whether 1 or more questions)

4). Provision made for scrolling through multiple questions in an appropriately sized window or modal for the device if T&Q settings have all questions on one page

I'm curious how this in-line test would display (and function); and how it would compare to the Lessons Question that already exists.","07-Mar-2019 15:24;rainribbon;Like [~roehrsb@durhamtech.edu], I have questions about the implementation and accessibility of the proposed feature, including the following:
# If there's more than one quiz on a page, how do you prevent the student from opening more than one at once, generating data discrepancy errors and possibly saving blank answers over good ones?
# Will the ""embedded quizzes"" have any restrictions on available settings?  For example, I imagine all of the following elements/options might need to be disabled/removed to embed a quiz without having the page get unwieldy:
** timer bar
** question progress box
** multiple questions per page
** table of contents
** immediate feedback to be displayed during quiz take
# How will the quiz be embedded? If frames are used, will it be responsive to different screen sizes?
# Where will feedback, if enabled by the instructor, be made available?  Can the instructor choose in which place(s) the feedback displays?
** in Samigo and Lessons
** only in Samigo
** only in Lessons
# If the instructor wants several questions on the same lesson page, where each question is a prerequisite for the next item on the page, must the instructor create multiple individual Samigo quizzes, each quiz having one question?  *Note:* This is a problem I've discussed with an instructor recently - he wanted to have his students in an online class watch a video, then answer a question or two to demonstrate that they paid attention to the video. If the student answers the questions *correctly*, they are permitted to take the quiz for the lesson.  This is not possible with the current _Lessons_ Question structure (answering the question at all, whether correct or incorrect, counts for the prerequisite), so I'm wondering how it would work if the embedded questions were quizzes instead?
# If the instructor has to create many quizzes to embed questions in different places on a lesson page, won't all these little quizzes clutter up the _Tests & Quizzes_ screen, too?  Will the ""embedded quizzes"" be organized/grouped in a separate section on Samigo's page?  The primary concern voiced by multiple community members about the SAK-34820 Samigo main screen redesign (continuing to display a separate *Draft* version after each quiz is published) has still not been addressed, and I can see this being even more frustrating to users if they create several quizzes embedded on lesson pages.","13-Mar-2019 15:15;rainribbon;If I were creating these embedded quizzes as an instructor, I think I'd like to be able to create a single quiz for each lesson page, such that questions could be embedded in different parts of the lesson page (and potentially have each question be a prerequisite for other questions or access to other items on the page), while all questions for the corresponding lesson page still appear as part of the same quiz within _Tests & Quizzes_.  I would also want to be able to prevent students from accessing the corresponding embedded quiz within the _Tests & Quizzes_ tool (so I could control access to questions/feedback entirely via Lessons, if desired).

Honestly, I'm not sure it would be wise to try to leverage the existing _Tests & Quizzes_ code to embed questions on lesson pages.  The main reason for this is the issue that I brought up in question #1 in my comment above: if a student attempts to open more than one quiz simultaneously in different windows (or in this case, different quizzes in different frames within the same lesson page) OR to open feedback for one quiz while attempting to take another quiz, it is likely to result in lost student answers and errors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are 3 types of Rubrics:
    1. Core Rubrics, provided by the University or institution
    2. User-created rubrics
    3. User own rubrics. These were originally based in either types (1) or  (2) and then saved for each user to re-use as templates in different questions/sites. - this can be accessed through ""My Rubrics"" tab.

We have been using them at Rutgers for some time now, and some people finds them useful.

When being created:
Each rubric can have its rows,columns, content of cells, points and comments customized.

When grading:
Should a rubric has""weighted"" points, these will be assigned to each item or assignment, allowing the user to fine-adjust said points. For instance, for a given question, a rubric cell grants 70% of total points which will be marked in the assignment/samigo question. Then the grades can adjust this up/down.

3. Student Feedback: after graded, each student can see the highlighted cell category and points granted by the rubric.

For a test case, please see attached pictures.

Some uses:
1) Adding Core Rubric to Samigo's short answer question ( 'adding_ru_short_answer... 'pictures 1 through 6)

2) Adding a custom rubric and saving it as ""My Rubric"" to re-use it later on as a template ('creating_rubric' set of pictures 1 - 5)

# new thread
# read thread
# response thread

In that issue, he's proposing that Forums is creating too many new events. 

[~drramsey], does this contradict what you are seeing?","06-Nov-2018 16:26;alanregan;Thanks, [~sfoster9].

My ticket (SAK-40411) suggests that for select actions, there are too many events recorded.  Someone shouldn't receive a ""read"" stat for writing a message or reply, in my opinion.  That, or there needs to be a separate ""read own"" and ""read other"" stat to provide added context to the activity of reading a message.  This way, instructors can more effectively assess engagement in Forums.

For this ticket, I think what [~drramsey] is suggesting is the creation of a new stat to simply record the ""click"" (or selection) of the button, not the actual ""post"" of the message. Basically, to record the intent to post a message or response, which is separate from the actual completion of the posting.

From my perspective, the value of Derek's feature request would be to capture any disrupted intentions (such as someone taking multiple hours to post a giant response and the system times out). It would also capture abandoned responses (clicked the button, decided didn't want to reply, and navigates away, closes tab, etc.).  I can see some value in the former and perhaps a researcher would be interested in the latter ( ? ).

Both tickets might point to a bigger topic of naming the Forums events to match the current user interface or segmenting the events into more specific/meaningful labels.

The statistic ""new thread"" is a legacy label from Sakai 2.8 and earlier when the button used to say ""Start a New Thread"" (or something similar).  In Sakai 2.9, the language was changed to ""Start a New Conversation.""  There could be some value in creating parity between the user interface and the event statistic label.  (Open to debate, of course.  Would be a separate ticket if one doesn't already exist.)

For this ticket, the challenge will be distinguishing the events of ""I have selected the button to start a message"" and ""I have successfully posted my new message.""  Given that the main button is called ""Start a New Conversation,"" the verb ""start"" could easily be confusing to instructors in the events log.  Imagine that ""start new thread"" and ""new thread"" were both present, for example.  Perhaps the stats become ""Selected new conversation"" and ""Posted new conversation"" if initiating a new thread?  If the ""Post"" button becomes ""Submit"" with a future user interface update, then modify the statistic label(s) accordingly.

If that pattern was adopted for ""Start a New Conversation,"" then you'd then need ""Selected reply"" and ""Posted reply"" if the action is a ""Reply"" to an existing conversation.

FWIW, I am using the verb ""select"" over ""click"" in this context since others have suggested that ""select"" is more inclusive of different interaction methods while ""click"" is specific to a physical mouse/trackpad click or mechanism.  Consider any label suggestions as just brainstorming/ideas, not a formal request or proposal.

And we could have a long talk over the verbs ""view"" vs. ""read."" :)

Anyway, I hope something here helps!","08-Nov-2018 11:11;sfoster9;Thanks for clarifying, [~alanregan]. ","08-Nov-2018 15:37;alanregan;[~drramsey] (and others), can more details be provided on the motivation and use case? The reason I ask is that the statistic might offer some value, but what is the core problem attempting to be solved?
 * Is the issue providing stats to instructors?
 * Is the issue providing a safety net to students writing forum/topic posts?

The statistic might help an instructor see if a button was clicked or process initiated. Beyond that, it doesn't offer much. If I assigned a topic to be discussed by a deadline, I can see that a statistic that proved the student clicked the ""start"" or ""reply"" button 2 minutes before the deadline could help me respond to the student. On the other hand, if a student ran into an issue days ahead of a deadline, the statistic might verify that a process was started, and could offer a point of sympathy/empathy, but it doesn't excuse work that still must be completed.

If the motivation is lost Forums responses due to a computer problem (anyone who has had an operating system force a restart suddenly can have sympathy about an ""unrecoverable"" moment), then perhaps auto-saving Forums responses as ""drafts"" might be a better way to go?  The statistic could still be pursued, but perhaps enhancing the auto-save functionality might be a more worthwhile venture.  The CKEditor has some auto-save functionality, but it seems very limited.  A more robust auto-save process in Forums – and a way for an instructor to view orphaned response attempts by student or topic – might better address the motivation (if that is the goal of the ticket)?

Been thinking about this ticket, so just wanted to ask about the motivation to see if other approaches might help.","09-Nov-2018 07:26;cschwiebert;Since Derek created this at my request, I can probably explain my motivation. I often have to try to recreate what a student was doing from event logs. Instructors have contacted me, saying that a student missed posting in a discussion by the deadline and claims that they tried to post but it never appeared. If this was a problem with Sakai, then the instructor may be lenient and allow them to post late and still get full points.

Forums can be a challenge to recreate from the event log, since there are just two common event triggers - marking a post as 'read' and creating a post.  If a student goes to Forums, clicks to create a new conversation, starts to type and either takes too long or walks away and Sakai automatically logs him out, I see nothing in the events. It's the exact same I'd see if they just walked away from their computer without ever trying to post to forums. If I can see that the student started to compose a reply, I may be able to identify from the event timestamp if they timed out there or clicked a button. It gives me more information to try to see if there was a technical glitch with Sakai, a student error (clicking Cancel instead of Post) or a student who just forgot to post and is claiming ""Sakai ate my homework"" to get another chance.

The more robust auto-save and the ability for the instructor to see abandoned attempts is certainly valuable! I had just thought the event may be easier to implement, not step on as many other projects, and give more information about what users were doing. ","21-Feb-2019 10:24;hauerwas@providence.edu;At my institution we're often asked by students to follow up regarding lost forum posts.  I, too, would appreciate an event that indicates when a user starts to compose something in Forums (e.g. forums.compose) versus when they post something (either forums.new or forums.response).

[~alanregan], yes, absolutely – better auto-save would help avoid situations where students ""lose"" posts.  But the addition of an event to track a user's intention to post would help admins see a timeline of events, whether or not that auto-saving existed?

Move the student-facing site information (e.g. site URL, site contact and email, LaTeX status) from ""Site Info"" to ""Overview"" (formerly known as ""Home"").

*PROBLEM TO SOLVE*

The ""Site Info"" tool has a confusing name for site managers (instructors and maintain users). In order to rename the tool to something that better matches its overall purpose (e.g. ""Settings""), some of the detail that students see needs to move to other locations. Students only see select information in Site Info, such as site URL, site contact and email, LaTeX status, and site description.

*KEY ELEMENTS*

The ""Overview"" tool already displays the ""Site Description."" This request asks for the site URL, contact.email, and LaTeX status to be added to the Overview tool. For example, add a ""Details"" button next to the ""Link"" and ""Help"" buttons in the ""Welcome"" panel. Clicking this button would popup a window to display the URL, contact name and email, and LaTeX status.

 * The ""Link"" button that already exists in the ""Welcome"" panel of the ""Overview"" tool points to the direct tool in the site, not the base URL of the site. This is the reason why I am including the site URL in this Details button.
 * I proposed the name for the new button as ""Details,"" but it can also be ""Site Info"" or ""Info"" if people want nostalgia. I thought a change might be nice, and it might also avoid confusion across different versions of Sakai. I'm completely open to whatever name or even interface option is best to present this site detail.

Based on feedback, adding details on design ideas below...

*DESIGN IDEA 1:*
 * This adds a new button called ""Details"" into the ""Welcome"" panel's heading bar, near the existing ""Link"" and ""Help"" buttons.
 * Clicking the ""Details"" button opens the same style of window as clicking the ""Link"" button. This window displays the desired participant-related site information display details from ""Site Info"" (e.g. Site URL, contact details). The original image included the ""LaTeX"" status, but feedback suggests that this detail may not be relevant to standard users (e.g. student or access users).

*DESIGN IDEA 2:*
 * This option adds a collapse/expand icon to the right of the ""Welcome"" panel's heading bar (e.g. a double chevron up/down icon).
 * When clicked, the information drawer expands/opens to display the additional site details that are participant-related (e.g. Site URL and contact details).  When clicked again, the information drawer collapses/closes.
 * The images of the design (3_overview_details_chevron-collapsed.png and 4_overview_details_chevron-expended.png) currently display Site URL and site contact (owner name and email). This drawer of information could easily display additional content, such as short description or LaTeX status.
 * By having the state ""collapsed"" by default, it would reduce information overload or clutter on the page.

*DESIGN IDEA 3:*
 * A twist on Design Idea 2, this suggestion would place the expand/collapse interface icon at the very bottom of the ""Welcome"" panel. Essentially, place a footer bar at the bottom of the panel, below any site description content. This would place the expand/collapse drawer of additional site content at the very bottom of the ""Wecome"" panel.
 * This approach keeps the focus on the full site description and tries to keep UI/UX standards consistent for the synoptic tool heading bars (""Link"" and ""Help"" buttons only).
 * By having the state ""collapsed"" by default, it would also reduce information overload or clutter on the page.

*DESIGN IDEA 4:*
 * This option would create a new synoptic tool panel for the ""Overview"" tool that focuses on the site information display details for standard site users. 
 * Since the ""Welcome"" panel (formerly known as ""Site Information Display"") currently displays the full site description, then this new panel could display the additional details, such as Site URL, site owner, etc. For example, a comment suggested adding the site's short description.
 * This approach/module/content could potentially be re-purposed by Lessons to place student-relevant ""Site Info"" details within Lessons. The use-case here is that an instructor may want to use ""Lessons"" as the primary site content pathway, and plans to disable/hide the ""Overview"" tool within the site design.
 * As a separate panel, it would take up more screen real estate, and unless the state of the panel is collapsed by default, it may add to information overload or ""clutter"" on the page. Ideally, the panel would display below the ""Welcome"" panel (on the left of Overview) rather than adding to the right panels (e.g. Announcements, Calendar, Message Center, Chat, etc.).

 * Is the *Details* button being proposed to show up on every tool, everywhere, for consistency with the *Link* and *Help* buttons?  *Link* and *Help* actually become problematic for accessibility when there are synoptic tools on the page and these tools each have their own *Link* and *Help* icons pointing to different pages depending which one you click.
 * If this info isn't supposed to show up everywhere, could it simply be displayed underneath the Site Info Display on the Overview?  I would not expect to have to click a *Details* button to look for my instructor's name or email.
 * Why is the LaTeX status needed?  I doubt students/members care if it's enabled, or do they need to know if it's available in case they might want to type some LaTeX in an assignment or something?

 ","08-Mar-2018 19:33;alanregan;Great questions, Tiffany!

The ""Details"" button is just one idea on how to bring the student-facing content from ""Site Info"" into ""Overview."" The original thought would be to place the button only on the ""Welcome"" panel (formerly the ""Site Information Display"" panel).  The ""Details"" button wouldn't appear elsewhere.

As you mentioned, the details can simply be listed below the ""Welcome"" panel someplace. Again, the thought of a ""Details"" button was just one idea of how to move the student-facing content from Site Info into an appropriate tool.  The tool already displays the site description, so it seems like a natural choice.

Another idea could be a module, similar to the Announcements or Calendar modules that have been discussed (developed?) for Lessons.  This way, if a course design wants to use Lessons as the central, student-facing content delivery method, then someone could add the site details module onto a Lessons page. Maybe a two-for-one (can use the panel in Overview or Lessons)?

Another idea could be a visibility toggle added to the ""Welcome"" panel's heading to expand when clicked and the details about the site display.  (Similar to how the chevron icon in the rich text editor here in JIRA allows you to toggle on/off the rich text editing toolbar.)  Lots of possible options.  I'm sure the UX/UI gurus can think of good ways to present the info, and make sure that the feature is accessible.

Regarding displaying the site contact details, this is just included to try to provide the same info in ""Site Info"" for students. Since only one site owner is possible, it doesn't offer much value for multi-instructor situations.  And, in my opinion, folks should be placing the contact information (name, email, phone, office hours) into the ""Welcome"" description anyway... at least, I find it valuable to personalize a site and engage the student from the first visit.

Finally, I mentioned ""LaTeX"" since it's currently visible in ""Site Info"" for students.  Again, just wanted to present all the basic info in ""Site Info"" that students see in another convenient location.  I don't use LaTeX myself.  I wonder if the inclusion of the LaTeX status for students may be an oversight within ""Site Info""?  I'm not sure how much value it offers the student, but there may be cases where it helps from a support perspective?  (A help desk operator asking a student to check if LaTeX is enabled if the student is asking for help entering a LaTeX formula someplace else in the site?)

In the end, the location of the site details, wording of any button, etc. all up for discussion and design brainstorming. Heck, if the community concludes that the information students see in Site Info is readily available elsewhere, this feature request can be canceled. I created this request, though, in response to prior concerns about making ""Site Info"" a faculty-only tool and making sure student-related features of ""Site Info"" are present elsewhere.

A long response, but I hope this helps highlight my initial thoughts. Thanks!","09-Mar-2018 11:04;sfoster9;I have been in favour of a new synoptic panel that could appear on the Overview page that would provide the student-focused site details and contact information. I would also like to re-imagine how the site description (long and short - are both needed?) would work with Site Info, Overview's Site Information Display, and this new Site Info synoptic panel. 

Most of our instructors put content on the Overview page as the landing page of the site that wouldn't be consider the site's ""description"". I think we need to break apart the ""site description"" from the ""Site Information Display"" panel.","12-Mar-2018 08:55;rainribbon;[~alanregan], I would prefer something that simply displays the information to something that hides it in a button.  As a student, I would never think to click a *Details* button to find my instructor's email address - this seems counterintuitive to me, but I do think the information is important to include somewhere for students.

I would prefer not to increase the number of synoptic tools on Overview if it's not absolutely necessary, and if no provision is made to let site owners turn off synoptics for tools they use in their sites.  Some instructors put their entire syllabus/schedule, complete with links to activities, in the Site Information Display (and, yes, I know this would be better suited for a lesson page, but that's beside the point).  Synoptic tools take up page real estate, which can be irritating to those who want the home page for their site to just display the information they include.  I'm aware that users can contact support to request that the synoptic tools be deleted from the page, but this would increase support burden if there were suddenly a number of users who didn't want a new synoptic tool showing up.

That said, if an option is developed for users to disable/hide synoptic tools from site participants, I think it would be fine to add the site info as a new synoptic on Overview.

[~sfoster9] in *Home > Preferences*, users can set site tabs to display *Short Description* (if one is added) instead of *Site Title*.  A *Short Description* will also display in a search for joinable or publicly listed sites, so I think it is still needed.

 ","12-Mar-2018 14:41;alanregan;As suggested earlier, another design option is a simple expand/collapse chevron at the right of the ""Welcome"" pane to create an information drawer. This would only be an interface item intended for the Welcome pane (not other synoptic tools for Overview). The interface item should be keyboard / screen reader friendly with appropriate labels and actions for accessibility purposes.

*View when collapsed* (details are not displayed)

!3_overview_details_chevron-collapsed.png!

 

*View when expanded* (drawer expands and details are visible)

!4_overview_details_chevron-expanded.png!

**************************************

Again, this is simply one proposed design.

In the above design images, the ""Site URL"" and ""Contact"" (i.e. site owner) details are displayed. I did not include the ""LaTeX"" status since feedback suggests that this isn't relevant for students to see. It can easily be added, if the community desires it as an option.

I'm working on at least one more design option to take other feedback into consideration.

My thanks to everyone for the feedback and ideas so far!","12-Mar-2018 15:29;rainribbon;Hi Alan, I like the mock-up with the info expanding under the Welcome title.  However, it's unclear to me what you are clicking to expand it out?  There would need to be some clear visual indicator that something of interest is there for users to expand out.

That said, it would be nice if the site owner/admin had a check box where they could select to keep it expanded by default (in case they want their contact info to be at the top of the welcome page - I can see this being useful for project sites that may change their ownership/contact from time to time).","12-Mar-2018 16:24;alanregan;Thanks, [~rainribbon].  If you looked at the first versions of the images for the ""Welcome"" collapse/expand icon in the header, I didn't add arrows to highlight the icon.  I revised the images and added arrows to try to indicate the interface icon. The placement of the icon can be revised, of course. I did use the same style of icon already used in Sakai for expanding/collapsing the left menu, for consistency. [https://sakai.screenstepslive.com/s/sakai_help/m/68426/l/728638-what-is-the-home-tool-menu]

A slight change on the same concept would be to move the expand/collapse icon and ""drawer"" immediately below the ""Welcome"" heading bar. This might make the icon/selection more apparent?

*Idea 2 version B* (drawer hidden/collapsed)

!5_overview_details_topbar_chevron-collapsed.png!

*Idea 2 version B* (drawer open/expanded)

!6_overview_details_topbar_chevron-expanded.png!

NOTE: In the above images, I used a darker gray for the drawer bar, but the color or option should adhere to the appropriate user interface design standards. Someone with more UI/UX experience can propose the best choice here.
----
Regarding an option to set a default state for the detail drawer: Tiffany, I see your point on the display preference. I could definitely see that an instructor or site maintain user might want to set the default collapse/expand state of the detail drawer.  This selection would likely need to reside in two places for an instructor/maintain user: (1) ""Overview"" > ""Edit"" (in the ""Welcome"" panel) and (2) ""Site Info"" > ""Site Information Display."" A single checkbox option would likely be the only item needed, to choose something like ""Display/expand the additional site details drawer by default."" If selected, the drawer should be expanded by default. If not selected, it's hidden/collapsed by default. However, the mechanism (single checkbox or two radio buttons) would depend on the preferred user interface choice for the system as a whole for user experience consistency. Again, I defer to others that have more experience with the best design options here for UI/UX choices.

Thanks again for the great comments.","12-Mar-2018 17:35;rainribbon;Thanks for the mockups!

I'm still not sure the purpose of the chevrons will be clear to users - I'd prefer something like a button or bar with text that makes it obvious (something like *Site Contact* maybe?)  As for the existing chevrons, I cannot recall working with a user who intentionally hid the left-hand tool menu using them - only one user who accidentally clicked them and then had difficulty finding which tools he needed!

Honestly, in all our designs, I think we should carefully consider before using icons that are not visibly accompanied by text, as some users may find icons difficult to work with (see for example [WebAIM's info about design considerations for users with cognitive disabilities|https://webaim.org/articles/cognitive/conceptualize/]).  I know we want a ""clean"" and ""modern"" interface (ironically, the current trend for ""modern"" is hearkening back to hieroglyphs!), but just because industry leaders like Google and Microsoft are replacing their textual menus with icons doesn't always mean it's helpful for users.

Regarding the option for site owners to have the details expanded - yes, I was thinking a simple checkbox in the edit screens for Site Info display to select that you want site details expanded on visiting the Overview page, where by default the checkbox is not selected, but the site owner/admin could select it to keep that panel open.","12-Mar-2018 18:39;alanregan;Thanks, [~rainribbon]. Based on that feedback, slightly revised design for ""idea 2"" adds a text label for the action. The language of the label (""More info"", ""Site Details"", ""Site Contact"", etc.) and whether the text and icon are in a button or other interface element can be locked down at a later time. Just wanted to have a quick visual.

*IDEA 2 version B with text label* (hidden/collapsed)

!7_overview_details_topbar_chevron-collapsed-label.png!

*IDEA 2 version B with text label* (open/expanded)

!8_overview_details_topbar_chevron-expanded-label.png!

Again, for this specific option, decisions that would still need to be made:
 * What the text label should say. A lot of possible options here (Site Contact, Site Details, Site Info, Show/hide details, More/Less info, etc.).
 * Should the text and icon be a button or some other formal element? Should the entire bar be clickable or just the text/icon?
 * Which icon to use. Double chevron, single chevron, plus/minus, or something else.
 * What details to include. Options such as ""Site URL,"" ""Primary Contact"" (site owner name and email), ""Short description,"" ""LaTeX Status,"" etc.
 * Sakai backend settings to allow an institution to enable/disable this setting, set the default state as open/closed, or only display select items?
 * Setting for instructor(s) to set the default state to open/closed?
 * Possibly checkbox settings for instructor(s) to set which items to display or hide in the drawer? (e.g. only show the short description, only show the site owner, or some other combination of possible details?)

A lot of good ideas and feedback – thanks again!","12-Mar-2018 19:16;rainribbon;Hi Alan, I really like the design with text added!  It is much more noticeable that way.

Of the suggested labels, Show/Hide Details sounds good to me.

I think it would be best if the whole bar is selectable/clickable. It can be hard to click tiny links or buttons, especially on touch screens/mobile.

Maybe the design could match the collapsing panels/sections that exist now in other tools, for example the current ""Groups I am a member of"" in Site Info, sections in Lessons, or the sections in Samigo Settings?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Personally I believe the permutations (user named sites / courses, institution named courses, etc) are too vast to apply truncation rules to.  We aren't even bringing into account internationalization.  

WHAT the communication is (aka source tool: announcement, assignment, etc) followed by the source (aka site. course, project) are the two most important items for email.  The title of the item being sent is secondary to the source when sorting one's email.  One could use the facebook notifications as a good example in how people seem to prefer chunking of information.  Facebook notifications are in three discrete categories: friend request, messages, notifications/events.  After that these items are displayed by who/what: person, event, or tied to a post.  The detailed content of the item itself is hidden because the user clicks through if the first two qualifiers cause them to dig deeper.

{quote}Based on the request, I wonder if simply creating a separate course site for each section would be easier or better? At our institution, we create unique sites for each section of a class. Rather than create one large ENG 101 site, we create individual ENG 101.01, ENG 101.02, etc. There are often different professors, and each professor has his/her own grading schema, set of assignments, etc. This would simplify the Gradebook setup and likely result in better system performance, too. If the individual sites were created from a template, then the same content could start in each section, and the individual instructors could modify things to their desire, especially if they are creating different assignments or activities that require different gradebook categories and items.

Perhaps if there was more detail on the reason behind the request, that would help? The technical details are clear, but not the motivation / academic use case. With a little more detail it may be easier to support this feature request. Otherwise, it feels like creating separate class sites or standardizing/generalizing the category labels might meet the need?

Hi [~alanregan]

Almost all the course sites have several sections in our institution . It is common for the instructors that every section has a different gradebook structure. Therefore we would need that the tool would be section aware. Creating a site per section is not the best solution for us because we have a lot of sections and it would be hard to manage a lot of sites per academic term.

Our instructors are able to access to current, last year and next year course sites. For example, this is a common use case in our institution:

An instructor has 6 course sites which have 4 sections per site. Furthermore they have access to the same 6 courses sites from last year. The total sum of sites to manage would be 6 courses sites x 4 sections per site x 2 terms = 48 sites. It is so hard to manage 48 sites. Therefore I believe that one site per section is not the best solution for us.

On the other hand almost all the sakai tools are section aware. Then, Why are not the Gradebook tools section aware?

I believe the GBNG should be section aware for all these reasons. Regards,

The following issues can arise when multiple instructors and TAs attempt to grade simultaneously:
* Grades fail to be saved
* Graders save blank entries over each other's entered grades and comments
* Grades and/or comments get saved for the wrong student (giving a student the grade and feedback belonging to a different student)

With these issues, multiple instructors and TAs need to carefully coordinate their dates/times of entering grades.

The problem is especially acute in _Assignments_ because two different students or two different assignments cannot be graded simultaneously.  So even if there are two TAs in the class who need to grade assignments specifically released to their own section rosters, they cannot grade at the same time.

As class sizes continue to increase, this is becoming an increasing problem. There needs to be better support for multiple graders in all tools.

I have no idea what is technically required to make it possible for multiple graders to work simultaneously - I suspect it will be extremely difficult, especially in Samigo, because it is probably tied up with how sessions are handled in Sakai. A number of separate jiras/subtasks will be needed for this feature request, but I'm creating this as a starting jira to make note of the issues.

What I'm more concerned about is that _Assignments_ will not allow two graders to grade two separate students (never accessing the same student's screen) at the same time, either.  Even if each instructor/TA is attempting to grade an entirely _different assignment_, grades can be saved in the wrong place or not at all if two instructors/TAs are trying to grade at once.

I am aware of an instructor who had TAs grade different individual _questions_ in _Tests & Quizzes_ (each TA selecting a specific question to grade from the *Questions* tab).  As far as I know, this was done successfully without the TAs overwriting each other's grades, but I would not recommend it because I think it would be just as risky as trying to grade in multiple tabs/windows in other tools.","01-Oct-2018 15:11;rainribbon;We discussed this issue in _Assignments_ today on the JIRA triage call. [~ern] mentioned that it relates to the handling of session variables.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have no idea how to implement the third in a way that would be useful to anyone. I can certainly include all the pages and items using the same XML structures that I use for archive. I'm just not sure that this would be useful to anyone. It looks to me like this would be more useful once I do CC export, as I could give XML using the CC schema. That's going to happen, but not soon.

What's the intended use? If you want to display things on a tablet, than you may actually be better off with the current structures from archive. Be aware, however, that the display code is fairly complex. It's very unlikely that a portal application would display the same thing as the web tool, particularly if conditional dependencies are in use.","09-Apr-2013 08:52;steve.swinsburg;This is part of Project Keitai and we have budget to implement it - we'll attach a patch.

The intended use of /direct/lessons/lesson/LESSONID.json|xml is to get the the page(s) within the relevant lessons tool as a data feed, which can then be rendered elsewhere, ie on a mobile device. Any pointers for API calls etc?","09-Apr-2013 09:37;hedrick;The low-level API is very straightforward. It's in SimplePageToolDao.java. You can look at LessonBuilderEntityProducer.java in the archive code. It converts all the data structures to XML.

However if you want to display on a PDA, the data isn't going to do you any good unless you're williing to replicate all the display logic in ShowPageProducer and SimplePageBean in the portable app. I don't thik that's practical. I strongly recommend not doing this, but instead getting HTML from the application, perhaps using special CSS.
","09-Apr-2013 16:06;steve.swinsburg;If we can get the XML then that is what we need. Though it sounds like the tool does a lot of access control/manipulation of that data which should probably be in the service layer and parsed before it is emitted. We'll take a look. We transform the data feed for all other services but that is because the data is clean and can be used as is (see SAK-23352).
Perhaps we can do something with the HTML though that is far from ideal since the target is a native mobile app.","10-Apr-2013 08:51;hedrick;If you want to be able to display from XML, the most promising approach is probably to supply an XML template and find a way to use the same producer to process the XML template as the normal HTML one.

There are a bunch of issues, including things like choosing the optimal way to display inline multimedia. But the most serious are prerequisite checking and handling inline content such as comments and inline questions. Student display is all done in the one producer, although comments are implemented by calling a separate template, with the resulting HTML patched into the page using Javascript. Authoring, however, requires a bunch of interaction that would be impossible to duplicate without just about completely duplicating the logic. Unfortunately in a number of cases, the Javascript is essential.
","10-Apr-2013 09:29;hedrick;The basic logic for whether to show an item is simple:

Display in order of sequence number, with sequence numbers < 0 at the end.
Show an item only if simplePageBean.isItemVisible(i)

Look for ""new SimplePageBean"" in LessonBuilderEntityProducer.java for how to instantiate a simplePageBean from the service layer. Basically the Dao just does database access. The common code you need to do display is in SimplePageBean. Even if an item is visible, it may not be available. That is shown by an icon. The code to determine that is in SimplePageBean, which is a de facto service layer for the display code. It does its own caching. If you look at the computations, I think it will be clear that we need caching at that level to get reasonable performance. 

I'm still skeptical that it's going to be practical to duplicate all the display logic. You can certainly try to redesign ShowPageProducer to be two levels. That's going to be a very challenging job. But it probably won't buy you much, since most of the code that can be separated out of the display code is already in SimplePageBean. So you're going to have to duplicate pretty much all of ShowPageProducer in the app. The most you can hope to do is produce a thin version of ShowPageProducer that does all the calls to lower levels and bundles them all into an XML object. But the actual display code won't be any simpler than the existing ShowPageProducer, and probably will be more complex. This will produce maintenance issues that I'm not going to be able to cope with. Every time a change is made to the UI, it's going to have to be made to the HTML producer in the tool and to the portable app. Any non-trivial request I get for changes to Lessons would require a change to both, no matter what layering is done in the Java code. Are you prepared to take on that ongoing responsibility? If you're interesting in assigning something like 1/4 to 1/2 FTE to Lessons on an ongoing basis, then I think we can do this, and I'd be happy to help restructure the code. I think the approach I'd take is what I described above: get ShowPageProducer to produce an XML version of the page by using a different template. Remember that the HTML I produce is actually XHTML, so you might want to think whether a separate version is necessary, or we can add annotations to the HTML to help you process it.

","10-Apr-2013 16:06;steve.swinsburg;This part of keitai is not concerned about the resulting display at all. It is purely in getting the data  that can be used at a later date. Ie a data structure that represents a question, or a piece of content. The work will be completed and contributed. It is expected that minor maintenance will be funded at a later date. It is also expected that unless you change the API in a backwards incompatible way, that this will continue to work. It may lack features until they can be implemented but that is ok. ","19-Apr-2013 08:04;hedrick;If you simply dump all the attributes, I can maintain that. There are possible permissions issues with some of them. There's no problem with showing an XML form of the internal data structures to an instructor. However there are things a student shouldn't see.

","16-Jul-2013 06:42;steve.swinsburg;Hi Chuck,
Just wondering if you've been able to review this? I have and its pretty good (I didn't write it but oversaw the development).","17-Jul-2013 09:28;hedrick;Trunk is currently frozen except important bug fixes, pending release of 2.9.3. Several sites (including ours) intend to use trunk in production. Most of the recent changes have been the same in trunk and 1.4.x, and QA is happening in both trunk and 1.4.x. So we need, and I think will have, a QA'ed release of trunk, as well as 1.4.x. Once that's past I'll do Keitai and a couple of other things.

","18-Jul-2013 16:14;steve.swinsburg;I think you should be branching trunk, if its frozen, then QA'ing that branch as well as 1.4, then trunk can move on. Then releasing tags from both branches.","18-Jul-2013 18:25;hedrick;I don't really want to work on more than 2 branches at once. Sorry, but i have limited time available. Supposedly it should be only a few weeks. You can certainly do the patch yourself in a local copy. 
","19-Jul-2013 01:03;steve.swinsburg;I'm talking about general release practice here, that you dont release from trunk. Especially so for core tools. That will allow you to move trunk on. This is off topic though and should be discussed on list.

As for this patch, I have already applied it and tested it, and was seeking your feedback. Cheers.","06-Aug-2013 10:07;hedrick;I've started looking at the code. I'm going to end up rewriting all the access control. I assume it will be OK otherwise.

It looks to me like this can be used by any user to retrieve any page or item, right? That's not a problem. I can copy code from LessonBuilderAccessService, or more likely reorganize it so I can just call an access check from there. If it can just be used by instructors, that would greatly simplify access control.
","06-Aug-2013 10:32;hedrick;The check for an item needs two things:
* can they get to the page (for items, the page on which the item appears)
* is item available (all prereqs met) and visible (group access met)

The check for a page needs:
* lessons read permission in site
* page group restrictions met (will have to use the recursive check from LessonsGradeInfoProvider. This is more complex than the check for an item on the page, because we have to see whether there is any path through the page graph that can validly lead here.
* is page item available (all prereqs met). Note that a given page can be access from more than one item, so if you need to be able to access a page without knowing the item it is accessed from, this will require a search of the graph. 

The way this is actually done in the Lessons UI is easier, because we can cheat. We always know what path a user has come to a page from. So we can check whether they have actually accessed the source page. Then we just need to do a normal item permission check on that item. That's easy. But if we need to go directly to a page, the check involves a full graph analysis. I already have the code for that in LessonsGradeInfoProvider. It works only because of heavy caching. I can do a version of that code that adds the prerequisite checking fairly easily.

If you expect this code to be used a lot, I'm going to need to look carefully at caching. Mostly I can use the same cache as LessonsGradeInfoProvider, but I may need a bit more.
","07-Aug-2013 07:30;steve.swinsburg;Thanks for looking into this Chuck. The idea is that it will be used by a mobile app so both students and instructors.

/direct/lessons/user/NNNN.json has the same problem.

Do you want to fix this or should I?
","23-Aug-2013 09:19;hedrick;I'd rather have you do it. There's too much magic going on in the class for me to know what to do.  Once you get it fixed, I'll look at merging in the existing /direct/lessonbuilder, and the access controls.
","23-Aug-2013 10:12;hedrick;Do we need check tool for every call? It seems to me that if the item exists, the tool has to exist. Perhaps the question is whether the tool is hidden, but that should be reflected in the hidden flag for the top-level item. If it's not, the user can get it from the index of pages anyway.

Basically my concern is that if we have a lot of mobile traffic, I want to minimize the number of queries. I'd like to avoid a getSite.

","23-Aug-2013 17:45;steve.swinsburg;There is a /direct/lessonbuilder - this is /direct/lessons - so they should operate independently and can be merged at some stage - what is /direct/lessonbuilder used for?

Will get the developer to fix the issue you mentioned.

As for the tool check, if its in the top level item thats fine it can be removed - but the idea is that if the tool is hidden then people shouldnt get access since the API calls can circumvent the portal hiding controls. I wouldn't be concerned with another getSite though - the cache will handle it.

Will attach a replacement patch.","23-Aug-2013 19:04;hedrick;Thanks. You're right that /direct/lessons and /direct/lessonbuilder don't conflict. But I'd think most users would find it weird to have both. The only thing /direct/lessonbuilder is used for is a PUT (or is it POST?) request to allow uploading a Common Cartridge. Blackboard asked for that to help load up sites for automated testing. Since /direct/lessons doesn't implement PUT it shouldn't be hard to merge the functionality.

I'm going to have to add a call to isItemAccessible for each item. In addition to its other checks, that will check whether the top-level page is hidden. The check you're using will largely duplicate that, and isn't 100% reliable. A page can be moved in the hierarchy. I don't go back and change the items to point to a different tool. The reason I don't try to maintain it is that I eventually realized that it can't actually be maintained. It's quite possible for an item to be accessible from more than one tool. isItemAccessible does something more complex, that finds whether an item can be accessed from any tool in the site.

","21-Jan-2016 14:55;jonespm;I think this sound complicated with a lot of possibilities and maybe not something I'd want to see tackled right now. This is the same description as the request at https://jira.sakaiproject.org/browse/GRBK-1429.

Would this be minimum score for the course or minimum score for any individual item? The way it's described in the picture on GRBK-1429, if they got below the minimum score even on a single item they don't get a course grade, that doesn't make sense to me. 

I also feel like many people would interpret this more like ""this is the minimum points it's going to assign for completion"". So instead of 0-100 possible points.(for 100 points) it's 60-100 possible points, no matter how badly a score it is. (Like of like a curved grade) 

It seems really confusing to me when it's locking down the determination of the final course grade based on some items.
","22-Jan-2016 05:27;jmarianolujan;Hi Steve and Matthew,
Thanks for your comments, let me clarify it a bit more.
As Matthew is saying, it is the same issue described in GBRK-1429 (that one was intended for GB2) and since we are planning on moving from GB2 to GBNG, we will be opening github issues for all the functionality missing in GBNG, to start the discussion and prioritize functionalty with others from the community: https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/SG2X/Moving+from+Gradebook2+to+GradebookNG

So, back to this issue:

This is a piece of functionality that was included in our old 'custom' grading system and that Instructors at our institution still ask for. It is intended only for individual grading items, it's NOT a minimum course score, its a minimum gradebook item score that students need to achieve in order to get a FINAL GRADE. Here is simple example:

MATHS - FINAL GRADE (100%) is the sum of FINAL EXAM+LAB 1+LAB 2+LAB 3+PROJECT with a 'minimum score' condition set on the item FINAL EXAM.
        - FINAL EXAM: 40% (minimun score set on 50 out of 100)
        - LAB 1: 10%
        - LAB 2: 15%
        - LAB 3: 15%
        - PROJECT: 20%

The instructor might request their students that in order to pass the course they need to get at least a 50% in the score of the final exam (this is why I said in my first comment that this might look like a conditional release).
Then, a student could have top grades in LAB 1, LAB 2, LAB 3 and PROJECT (60% of the final grade) but do bad on the FINAL EXAM and recieve just a 30% out of 100% which in is a 12% out the 40% that the FINAL EXAM is worth within the final grade. Since the 'minimun score' for the gradebook item FINAL EXAM was set to 50% and the student got a 30%, then, the final grade wont be calculated. That student will need to take that FINAL EXAM again until he gets the 50% requested by the instructor in order to pass the course.

Does it make more sense now? As I said, it is a real use case from many instructors at our institution. Right now, what they do, is that they handle the minimun score in a manual way, if the student has not reached that minimun score in a gradebook item, they don't add the FINAL GRADE to the university SIS (Student Information System) and they ask the student to re-do/re-take the gradebook item that they are missing.
","23-Jan-2016 16:12;steve.swinsburg;To clarify just a bit more, if the minimum grade isn't met for a gradebook item, is that item excluded from the course grade calculations (so if you had 5 items and only 4 qualified, only the points from the 4 would be used) or does the course grade just not get calculated at all unless all 5 qualify?

Seems pretty simple to add a flag to each item which then contributes to the calculations, as well as an overall setting to toggle the feature on/off, just need to make sure the priorities and community requirements are managed.
","23-Jan-2016 16:20;jonespm;Yeah, I think that's most of my problem is the ambiguity of what ""Minimum Score"" would do. There's already ""Drop lowest"" but this might not be the lowest and it doesn't sound like he's saying he wants it dropped or not included in the calculations, he's saying he doesn't want any calculation at all. I've never heard of a grading system like this and I think it would be something you'd want to ""turn off"" or hide if it was implemented because it would be confusing.

In any case I'd probably expand the description from ""Minimum Score"" to ""Minimum item score required for final grade calculation"" even if it is wordy.

","11-Jun-2018 15:57;alanregan;I'm still trying to understand this use-case. I think I may understand... but want to confirm.

In the weighted example you provided...
 * LAB 1 = 10%
 * LAB 2 = 15%
 * LAB 3 = 15%
 * PROJECT = 20%
 * FINAL EXAM = 40%
 * TOTAL = 100%

...if a student gets a perfect score on the first 4 items (Lab 1, 2, 3, and Project), then technically, a student would not need to take the final exam in order to pass the class.  The student would squeak by, having earned 60% and would pass the class.

If – in addition to the raw math of the grade calculation – the instructor wanted to require a student to achieve at least a set amount (say, 50% or 60%) on one or more gradebook items, you'd need a method to set this ""Minimum Acceptable Score"" or ""Passing Threshold"" value.  You can't call this element a ""Minimum Score,"" since as Matthew said, it would be confusing to instructors.

I could see two interface elements.  First, a checkbox to mark the gradebook item as a required item.  By selecting the checkbox, it would say that the item must have a grade value greater than 0 (cannot be null or 0).  With just this bare minimum, it says that someone must at least attempt the item in order to pass the class.  (They couldn't just skip the final exam, for example.)  This assumes that simply turning in the exam would earn at least 1 point or something.

Second, an optional field to set a numerical ""Minimum Acceptable Score.""  This would be where an instructor could say that someone must achieve a certain value (like the 50 out of 100 you mention, Jose) to pass the class.  It sets a higher bar than simply the raw math calculation.

The main problem I have is that leaving a course grade blank is unacceptable, in my opinion.  For most, a blank course grade communicates a technical problem – the Gradebook is broken and hasn't computed the grade.  It's not intuitive or obvious to most students or instructors that a ""blank"" course grade means ""re-take the final exam.""  At the bare minimum, a text warning of ""Contact your instructor"" should be displayed. The community might have other ideas, but a slightly more verbose message might help, such as ""Some course requirements not met. Please contact your instructor.""  For the instructor, perhaps the raw calculation along with another indicator to mark the item as incomplete? (Maybe a yellow triangle with exclamation point?)  I don't see that leaving the grade blank would be clear to either audience, but would like to hear other voices in the Sakai community chime in.

[~jmarianolujan] or [~raulsv] – is my perception above close to the use case or goals you are hoping to accomplish?

 ","22-Jun-2018 02:19;raulsv;Hi [~alanregan]

Thanks for your suggestion. I agree with you on the field should be called ""Minimum Acceptable Score"" better than ""Minimum Score"". It is true that a blank course grade (when the Minimum Acceptable Score is not reached in the required grade item) it's not intuitive. IMHO the final course grade could be overwritten by the lowest label from the grading schema ('F' in the 'Letter grades' schema or 'NP' in the 'Pass/Not Pass' schema ) when the Minimum Acceptable Score is not reached in the required grade item.

I also agree on adding a text warning like ""Some course requirements not met. Please contact your instructor."".

I believe that the checkbox to mark the gradebook item as a required item should be unnecessary. I mean that if the ""Minimum Acceptable Score"" field is set to 0 or blank it should be the same as disabling this field. If the ""Minimum Acceptable Score"" field is set to a value greater than 0 it should be the same as enabling this feature.

IMHO the ""required item"" checkbox which means that the required grade item should be graded (does not matter which score is reached) to pass the class should be addressed in other ticket.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thank you for thorough testing. It seems that these are three different issues so that might indicate having three different Jiras. The Jiras could be linked or their could be a ""parent"" JIRA to connect them.

The tricky part about this for me though is not knowing if this is behaving as designed, in which case your observations and suggestions would be feature requests, or if they are truly ""bugs"" (aka not working as designed).

Does not seem like a blocker priority JIRA for the 12.0 release, imho.

 ","09-Feb-2018 12:30;luisa.li;Don't think it's blocker either.

As I see it, it works as designed and give more than designed. When you add a Resource folder in the Lessons, you can actually see all the files under the folder and open/download them if you click on them. In this interface, you can only add a folder, but you can see all the files under this folder. It may cause a bit confusion on the user's end. Do I check all the files or do I just click on the folder itself? That's what I meant by ""it gives more than designed"".

Lessons design give people 2 options if you want to link files or folders from the Resources tool:
 * Click ""embed content Link"" if you want 1 or multiple files
 * Click ""add resources folder"" if you want an entire folder

It all seems neat and smooth. But how could a new user know the difference? Imagine I am a first time user, I want to link a file from the Resources tool. I see the button ""Add resources folder"" and ""embed content link"", I mostly likely will click ""add resources folder"" because it says ""resources"". Then I find out I cannot add files because it just keeps downloading. I am frustrated and don't know what I did wrong.

An UI expert may have better idea. My 2 cents is that we disable the file downloading function in ""Add resources folder"" popup window or add a note saying ""Here you can add an entire folder"".

As there are more and more functions going into Lessons, maybe we should look at workflow again and rename some of the function buttons, which will be totally another JIRA ticket.

I'm not exactly sure what you saw with

We saw issues with the ""fontAwesome"" with missing icons and such so just had to remove it.
{quote}
But yes, upon further testing, you can insert font awesome fonts, and after you save the icon is displayed when viewing the announcement, form, etc. or which ever tool it was used in.  But if you re-edit, the icon will disappear.  I seems as though ckeditor strips the icon because some tags such as <em> and <b>, if there isn't any text between the opening and closing tags, ckeditor will remove the whole tag.  And from the version of fontAwesome sakai had in Sakai 11 and the latest version of fontAwesomePremium, they changed to from using <span> to <em> to insert the icons.  where that problem didn't happen with <span>

so, it looks like we'll have to go back to using CKAwesome and modify their CSS' z-index, as you mentioned above, then wait for lesson builder's z-index to be adjusted... or wait for CKAwesome to stop hardcoding the zindex (I've started a git issue with them about it)","20-Nov-2018 17:51;austinUH;I filed a bug report with the authors of ckawesome, to see if they can fix the z-index issue from their end

"Remove support for ""externally linked"" gradebook items",SAK-32247,70513,New Feature,OPEN,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project.

I believe that the gradebook should be the authority and you should be able to edit the grades either in the tool or the gradebook. This would require

- Every tool needs to support adding to an already exiting grade. (I believe Samigo doesn't yet but was a work in progress :  SAK-29176)
- Every tool should have a way in the UI to either both link to an existing item or create a new item. (And then link to it)
- Each existing item (probably?) only allow one thing to link up to it. I feel like looking at discussion this is how it works now. Though because of bugs like SAK-29205 if titles match up it can get mixed up.
- All UI that allows for adding ""externally maintained"" grades should be removed, but probably we'd have to leave this code in the core for awhile unless a conversion process could be written.

The advantages of this would be much easier to use for the user and better expectations, probably better for future LTI outcomes that would allow better manipulation of grade items and supporting one less workflow for grading. Since editing in GBNG is so good we could push a lot of grading ideas through that now. (Like rubrics) rather than rewriting it in every tool too.

 * Standardize how gradebook items are created by tools within Sakai (or LTI tools).
 * Allow instructors to grade any activity within the Gradebook (removing the ""lock"" from items like Assignments and Tests & Quizzes).

My main concern is:
 * Rich text comments.

Will this process only cover scores/grades, but leave comments to the respective tools?  Or will there be a change in how comments are created and edited with Gradebook (GBNG)?

I simply want to be sure that the rich-text comment functionality within Assignments is not impacted.  If anything, I see this proposal opening the door to another feature request, which is the display of rich-text comments within Gradebook.  I can imagine an implementation similar to how the display of ""Site Information Display"" happens in Site Info (with plain text of a small amount of information by default, and a ""More"" link to open the content in a new display space with full rich-text information).

Anyway, big picture, this sounds like a great step forward. The detail I am concerned about is comments and how it may impact attached tools, like Assignments or Tests & Quizzes. Thank you!

 ","25-Jul-2018 08:14;jonespm;This still sounds like it would be great to do, but I'm unassigning myself as I won't be working on this in the short-term.","17-Aug-2018 14:11;rainribbon;I understand [~alanregan]'s concern about handling of additional feedback options from _Tests & Quizzes_ and _Assignments_.  As well as the rich-text comments in _Assignments_, both tools allow for adding attachments as feedback, and these cannot display/be downloaded via _Gradebook_.  _Tests & Quizzes_ also allows comments and attachments at each individual question level, which cannot be sent to _Gradebook_, but the plain-text comments for the assessment overall are sent to _Gradebook_.

I think it would probably be best to leave complex/rich-text comments and attachments in their respective tools.  Both Assignments and Samigo can already send some plain text feedback to the Gradebook - it should be sufficient for the instructor to indicate that the student should access the respective assignment/assessment feedback to get additional details.","08-Nov-2018 07:22;raulsv;Based in our users experience (University from Murcia), the Assignment option of assigning an external item to an already existing gradebook item have always caused several problems as:

1. 
    a) The instructor creates a gradebook item called ""grade 1"" and another one called ""grade 1.1"".
    b) The instructor creates an assignment item called ""assignment 1"". He wants to assign the ""assignment 1"" to the gradebook item ""grade 1"". The instructor is wrong on assigning items and he links  ""assignment 1"" to ""grade 1.1"" rather than ""grade 1"".

    c) 
       - Thus the instructor types grades in ""assignment 1"" believing they are being sent to ""grade 1"" but these grades are being sent to ""grade 1.1"". 

       - When the instructor checks the grades in ""grade 1"" there are no grades and he does not know why there are no grades.

       - On the other hand, he types grades in ""grade 1"" and he expects that these grades are being sent to ""assignment1"" but it does not happen because ""grade 1"" is not linked to any assignment. 

       - Furthermore when he types grades in ""grade 1.1"" they are being sent to ""assignment 1"" (because is linked wrong) but he does not know it. When the instructor goes to ""assignment 1"" he sees grades which he believes are incorrect because the grades should come from ""grade 1"" but they are coming from ""grade 1.1"" and he does not know it.

2. There can be an inconsitency between the scores that the instructor is typing in Assignment/Gradebook items and the grades which the students are seeing([SAK-40633|https://jira.sakaiproject.org/browse/SAK-40633]). Related to that, there are a lot of use cases when the assignment is assigned to an already existing gradebook item. You can check them in this [table|https://jira.sakaiproject.org/browse/SAK-40633?focusedCommentId=239113&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-239113]. 

3. There can be an inconsistency between the grade item configuration and the assignment configuration. E.g. The instructor creates a grade item which is worth 10 points and creates an assignment item which is worth 20 points. Now the instructor assigns the assignment item to the grade item. There is an inconsistency in the max points between both items (assignment and gradebook item).

That's why we strongly not recommend the option of assigning an assignment to an gradebook item that already exists. We believe that the only option which should exists is the option of creating a new gradebook item from the assignment tool. Thus we believe it is the only option which should exists in the other external tools which send grades to the gradebook tool.

2. Delete the individual dummy submission records when an assignment's type is changed to group submission.

3. Fix the code so that the dummy submissions are ignored for group assignments.

To implement 2, we'd have to identify which ones are dummy. This isn't entirely clear as some may already have submissions made. If submissions are made and group assignment is changed it either needs to.

(Going from group to regular)
- Assign the submissions for the group to each individual member that was part of the group.

(Going from regular to group)
- Assign the individual submission(s) to a group. (Not sure how this would work out with multiple)

I like your proposal: ""Instructors should have the flexibility to say Yes, send the grades to the gradebook but not right away"".

I think there is another big issue which you don't have taken into account: If the instructors want to send the scores right away (as they may want to work with the scores in Gradebook), they don't know that the scores are being visibles by students by default in Gradebook. Samigo should notify them.

There can be instructors that want the scores to be visible by default to students in GB and instructors that don't want the scores to be visibles by default. We believe that the best approach to consider all situations is to add an option to select whether the scores are visibles or not in Gradebook.","13-Feb-2017 13:38;jtingen;Triage discussed this and the feature sounds like a good idea.","11-Dec-2017 09:26;rainribbon;As per Slack discussion with [~lcira] regarding this issue, it might be nice to handle the issue in the following two ways (for #2, I do NOT think the button should be called *Release Grades* because calling it that would imply release of other feedback within Samigo, while release within Samigo must be controlled manually with selection of multiple settings):
 # If feedback is released *at a specific date*, make the *add the GB* option also respect that date (and not send grades until then).
 # For instructors who do not know in advance when they will want to release grades, and they choose NOT to send grades to GB in Settings, add a *Send* *to Gradebook* button on_Total Scores_. This button would do the following when clicked:
 ## Save the grades on Total scores.
 ## Automatically change the Settings on the published copy of the quiz to *Send grades to GB*.

_*Note:* On attempting to click *Send to Gradebook*, if a GB item already exists with the same title as the quiz, appropriate warning must be displayed to instructor that they will need to change the title of either the assessment or GB item for the score to be sent.  Wording of message can be taken from Settings screen when attempting to publish quiz with that setting if GB item of same title exists._","11-Dec-2017 09:47;rainribbon;Another possibility for #2 in my comment above would be to have a button on _Total Scores_ that triggers a *Scores/Feedback Release* type of pop-up or lightbox screen (if a lightbox, extra care would need to be taken to verify keyboard accessibility).  The effect of this screen would be to modify the *Settings* in the published copy of the quiz as per the selections you make in it.  For example:
 * Send grade to GB
 * Feedback available now
 * Feedback includes questions and...
 ** Student Response
 ** Correct Response

These new features could be addressed in a new ticket.

The main issue addressed by SAK-34782 is explained next:

1. The students submits an assessment (assessment settings: scores are not released to students. The scores will be sent to Gradebook).
2. The scores are not released to the students in Samigo but they are released in Gradebook because the gradebook scores from the external tools are always visibles to students by default.
3. The instructor does not know that the scores are released to students in the Gradebook tool.

This behaviour could be improved by adding an assessment configuration option (enabled/disabled with a property) that allows to intructors to choose whether the score will be visible (in GB) to students  or not when Samigo sends the scores to the Gradebook.

I believe it makes more sense to add the ""new category"" button next to the ""new grade item"" rather than keeping the ""new category"" UI within the general Gradebook Settings page. Thus the ""new category"" UI could be removed from the Gradebook Settings page.

I propose the following:
For *Linear Access* assessments ONLY, make an additional feedback option available:
* *Allow feedback during the assessment, after viewing each question.* _*Note:* If a student clicks the *Feedback* link while viewing a question, feedback is shown and they can no longer change their answer._

This could be presented to the instructor in the samigo _Settings_ page as follows:
* In _Grading and Feedback_, when the assessment _Navigation_ is _Random Access_ (default), the new option is shown, disabled, with the text: _To enable this option, in  *Layout and Appearance*, change Navigation to *Linear access to questions with NO return to previous pages.*_
* In _Layout and Appearance_, the instructor selects *Linear access to questions with NO return to previous pages.*
* Instructor can then return to _Grading and Feedback_ and select the option to *Allow feedback during the assessment, after viewing each question.*
* Underneath this new feedback option, a set of options, *Release question and the following after viewing a question*, would need to become active for the instructor to select which types of feedback to enable during the test-taking process.  (*Note:* The instructor may want to release only correct/incorrect answer feedback after the student views the question, and not the overall assessment score, e.g.)

For the student:
# Student begins assessment and views question.
# If the student clicks the *Feedback* link, regardless of whether they have entered any response, they'll see the feedback and all answer options will become inactive (selections grayed out, text box no longer editable, etc.)  There would also need to be a clear _*WARNING:* Clicking Feedback will prevent you from changing your answer to this question!_  The *Feedback* link should also be moved down on the page, BELOW the input for the question, so that screen reader users do not encounter it before they respond to the question.

Additionally, I've seen the following use cases from users who specifically wanted null due dates:
** Anonymous survey in a project site; users want to leave it open and reuse until indeterminate date
** Department that offers a placement exam, where the exam is generated as a random draw from question pool and reused from year to year in multiple sites.
* Similar to the above, the *late acceptance date* default (or null date) should be able to be set at an institutional level with a property.

A description of IF-AT assessments can be found here: http://www.epsteineducation.com/home/about/

In IF-AT quizzes, students get immediate feedback as to whether their answer is correct or incorrect, and then they can change their answer until they get the question right.  If they answer incorrectly, the number of incorrect attempts decreases their score for the individual question, resulting in partial credit for questions they answered incorrectly at least once.  The quiz would also have to prevent students from continuing to change their answer to a particular question upon entering a correct answer.

A potential workaround would be to develop SAK-34754, allowing students to only answer questions they got wrong during a second quiz attempt.  The instructor could use Feedback on Submission to indicate which questions were wrong or provide hints for them to arrive at the correct answers the next time and the students could make a new attempt at the remaining questions.  Taking the average score of all attempts would then approximate the desired partial credit scoring.

The instructor provided the following additional information regarding the IF-AT assessment format:

{quote}
I would like to recreate the process of taking these tests by paper as
closely as possible. Students are given a handout with all the
questions on it along with a ""scratchers"" sheet. These sheets are
available from the website you reference in your email. They function
similarly to lottery tickets where you scratch off what you think is
the correct answer and there is a star randomly placed in the
rectangle if you guessed correctly, and it's blank if not.

If this were computerized it would be MUCH more straightforward than
having to purchase these specialized scratchers and then match up the
questions with the pre-defined order on the scratchers. That said, I
definitely would want students to be able to see the entire test and
not be forced to make an answer to move on to the next problem. I
would say the most natural way to do this is to have to manually
register an answer choice for each problem, receiving immediate
feedback as to whether it was correct, and keeping a tally of how many
attempts they made. You would want to make it so they couldn't
continue making guesses once they got the answer correct. It would
also be nice to keep a tally of how many questions they have yet to
complete (i.e., having found the correct answer). So, you would
decouple moving around from question-to-question from actually
registering a response. The other cool thing is that they leave
knowing the score they got on the exam (which could obviously change
if the teacher decides to drop a question or curve the final values).

The scoring would need to be customizable. For example, in my classes
I typically use questions with 4 answers. If they get the answer
correct on one try, they get full credit, if they get the answer
correct on two tries, they get half credit, if they get the answer
correct on three tries they get one quarter credit. Finally, if they
only revealed the answer on their 4th try they get zero points, but
the at least learn what the correct answer is. Thus, the scoring is
not a linear effect of number of tries.

As someone who studies memory, I know there is a significant
improvement in long-term retention if students learn during the test,
itself, so from an educational standpoint this is a major improvement
relative to almost all standard testing approaches.

"PA System - Don't show ""Show System Alerts"" yellow banner on ""Low"" alert banners",SAK-40106,83347,New Feature,OPEN,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project. Please follow the <a href=""https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/MGT/Sakai+Jira+Guidelines"">Jira Guidelines</a>",http://sakaiproject.org,Major,,,alanregan,alanregan,08-Jun-2018 15:00,19-Sep-2018 13:31,18-Feb-2021 03:39,,11.4,12.0,12.1,12.2,19.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PA System,,,,,,,1,LSClient,UX,,,,,,,"+*ISSUE:*+

If an institution wants to place a dismissible ""cookie"" notification banner as a ""low"" alert, the alert should disappear when the ""x"" icon is clicked and there shouldn't be any other visual alert on the page (e.g. we shouldn't see the yellow ""Show System Alerts"" badge). This is similar to how other websites are placing notices about cookie usage. The PA System ""Low"" alert feature seems like a great fit for this use case, except for the yellow banner after dismissing the notice.

!pasystem_banner.png|thumbnail!

  !pasystem_banner_yellowbox.png|thumbnail!

+*REQUEST:*+

Adjust the PA System to allow the above use case.
 * *OPTION 1:* Keep the 3 levels and simply do not display the ""Show System Alerts"" badge at all for ""Low"" level alerts. It would only appear for ""Medium"" alerts.
 * *OPTION 1B:* Essentially, add a fourth level. Change the existing ""Low"" alert drop down option in the PA System to ""Low - with ""Show System Alerts"" box"" and add a new ""Low"" option ""Low - without ""Show System Alerts"" box.""
 * *OPTION 2:* Add a checkbox in the administrative PA System tool to enable/disable the display of the ""Show System Alerts"" badge on the screen. This way, an institution or admin can decide based on the context of each banner whether the ""Show System Alerts"" badge should display or not. The checkbox would be applicable for ""Low"" and ""Medium"" alerts only.
 * *OPTION 3:* Change the ""Show System Alerts"" badge either in placement, size, or presentation. Basically, make it visible but less obtrusive.  Perhaps it becomes a small icon-based notice at the left of the platform logo image; when clicked, then the banner re-appears.  Or perhaps becomes a menu item in the Profile menu when someone clicks his/her name at the top right.  Or a slight, yellow tab at the top middle of the page that displays fully on hover to display ""Show System Alerts"" message and link, and snaps back to a smaller size if you move away (and some method to keyboard and display it, too). Or some other less intrusive notification method to display the banner again?
 * *OPTION 4:* Something super awesome and cool that someone else thinks up and meets the need.

Adding an option to select to display/not display the system alerts box gives the admin more control over how the notifications are presented to users.

However, I'm also a big fan of Option 3 - making the system alerts box less obtrusive. I think that would be good regardless of whether or not Option 2 is implemented. The system alerts box is a little too prominent in my opinion, and seems rather distracting on the page for medium alerts. I think I'd prefer to see the system alerts box as an alert icon to the right of the logo in the top banner, with the ""Show System Alerts"" text on hover and image Alt text. (See sample image below.) Just my opinion though.

[~wilma@longsight.com], I love your design suggestion! The current ""Show System Alerts"" notice is definitely too visible right now. I like your suggestion of a less intrusive icon with title/alt/hover to indicate what will be revealed for a ""Medium"" alert.

samigo: Messages related to specific question types should only appear if question type enabled,SAK-34617,71225,New Feature,OPEN,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project.

*Issue:* Certain question types have messages that display in Samigo whether or not the question type is enabled in the local Sakai instance.  If the corresponding question type is disabled, the message can be confusing to those authoring assessments (or make them realize something is missing that they want to use as a result, even if it's been turned off because it's buggy). To remove each erroneous message, a local patch is needed.

Thus far, I've only noticed one question-specific message because it's the only question type UVA has disabled.  If there are other messages corresponding to specific question types, I'd encourage others to add them in description below.

*Proposed Fix:* Condition each question-specific message on the presence of the question in the local instance of Sakai.

A new Sakai property might be needed to handle this?  For example, IF *samigo.question.show.showImageMapQuestion = false*, THEN *samigo.question.warning.showImageMapWarning = false*

*To see message for Image Map questions when question type disabled:*
# In Sakai Properties for the Sakai instance, set *samigo.question.show.showImageMapQuestion = false*.
# Create an assessment with at least one question.
# Select *Export* from the drop-down for the test.
# See message: {quote}Note: Hot Spot questions won't be exported because they don't match with a standard question type. You can copy them from a site to another one using question pools or the Import from Site feature.{quote}

Because you'd have to have code that could display the questions as well as pulling the preview of the question in the remove context. I feel like it would be good to provide more information though. Or maybe not moving the workflow off to another page would be nice too. Did you have a fix for this or just a suggestion?","03-Apr-2017 13:34;rainribbon;[~lgekeler] Unfortunately, no; I just noticed it recently in testing.

[~jonespm] I would guess that because some question text displays on the _Remove Question Confirmation_ screen from a question pool, it should be possible to make the delete option from other screens display this text too.  However, I assume that currently, the other *Remove* links generate a different (blank) confirmation screen because question pools store the questions in a different way.

I don't think we can simply add the ""remove question"" option as a pop-up within the _Questions_ screen because you can remove a question from multiple screens:
# _Questions_ screen when authoring/editing test
# _Questions_ > *Edit* on individual question
# *Question Pools* > select pool or subpool > select question > *Remove*
# *Question Pools* > select pool or subpool > select check box(es) beside question(s) > *Remove* {color:red}<-- Only this method of accessing _Remove Question Confirmation_ gives any indication of what's actually being deleted{color}

To clarify, I'm requesting the following:
# Standardize the display of the _Remove Question Confirmation_ pages that are accessed from all 4 points listed above
# Make the _Remove Question Confirmation_ page display at the very least part of the question (like it does now when accessed via method #4 above).

An additional note: as far as I know, screens accessed via *Working Copies* and *Published Copies* are different places in the samigo code, so the 4 methods of accessing the _Remove Question Confirmation_ screen above might actually represent 6 different code locations (Assessment Builder screens in Working vs. Published Copies).","08-Jun-2017 12:32;rainribbon;[~ddelblanco] showed me a really nice question preview generated as part of the work in SAM-3115 and related jiras.  Perhaps this preview could be leveraged for the delete question confirmation screens?

I linked SAM-3115 to this jira, but they aren't really related; I just couldn't find a better ""link"" type to describe the relationship (like see also).","08-Jun-2017 12:43;ddelblanco;Yes, that preview was designed for the search but it should work for any other feature... 

In fact a link like this (modifying the toolid and the itemid) works (just tested) if you have the right permissions to view that question:

Just adding this link with the right parameters into a modal with some css in the delete confirmation screen and you will have a nice preview there.

If you need more fields... feel free to improve the preview jsf pages... :)

I think you can play with the example here https://jsfiddle.net/mclare/tcuqnbs7/#&togetherjs=04b1Rja8ml

Anything that considers dates across a site would be a big benefit to all roles in a site.","11-Apr-2017 12:28;alanregan;I've always thought that having two ways to set dates -- either static (such as exists today) or relative.  I'd like the relative date system to be available throughout the system, for any tool to take advantage of.  This way, conditional release, assignments, quizzes, etc. can have set open and close timeframes based on either day, week, etc.

For the setup, I imagine a menu that asks all of the particulars:
* Start Date
* End date
* Days class meets (e.g. Mondays and Wednesdays)
* Times class meets (e.g. 9:00 AM to 10:50 AM)
* Holidays/canceled class sessions (e.g. national holiday, spring break, etc.)

Ideally, much of this content would feed in from the SIS (such as start/end dates, days of week, times of week), so majority would be auto-populated.  With the above details, the system can calculate how many class periods there are, total number of weeks the course is offered, etc.  From there, instructors could open content by day number, week number, or class period number, set deadlines by these times or in relation to those options (such as 5 days after class session 3, or two weeks before week one for a Getting Started section of Lessons to be available before class officially begins, etc.).

When a site is copied or is created based on a template course, all an instructor or instructional designer needs to do is verify the date details in the settings (add new holidays, for example) and then click an ""update dates and publish activities"" button to schedule or release announcements, assignments, quizzes, resources, etc.

Would love for this to happen!","24-Aug-2017 15:06;alanregan;Added super rough mockup for a tool in Site Info to quickly adjust the dates of assignments. Totally rough and not complete, but tossing out for initial feedback.  NOTE: I only had PowerPoint to mock this up as quickly as possible. I'm sure others could create something more realistic.","28-Aug-2017 13:14;martinr@acaweb.org;I've uploaded two mocked up screen shots that have a different approach from Alan's, just in case it would be helpful.  In my vision, each site can (it isn't required) have a Site Start Date.  See the screen shot Site Start Date.png.

This Site Start Date is then used as a reference point when importing tools into a new site.  If the site(s) that is(are) the source site has a Site Start Date, the box outlined in red in the screen shot Import from Site with Date Adjustment.png will appear.  The user has the option to say that the dates should be left alone.  Or the user can specify a new Site Start Date for this site, and any tool that is imported will have the dates within that tool adjusted by a relative amount.  For example, if the Site Start Date for the source course is 9/1/16 and the site being imported to has a Site Start Date of 9/1/17, an Assignment that is due on 10/15/16 in the source course will become due on 10/15/17 in the target course.

Only sites that have a Site Start Date can be used in this manner.  Only dates within the tools actually imported would receive the adjustment.

As a nice added benefit, any tool that has an adjusted date could (and perhaps this should be the user's choice when specifying the import) also be made active or published.  For example, instead of a Forum question being left in DRAFT mode, if an adjusted date has been specified, the Forum questions so created could be published, saving the step of manually releasing the Forum questions one at a time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some variables that come up like this and are not always defined correctly are either defined as null or

mail.support -> usually ""support@""+ serverConfigurationService.getServerName()
setup.request -> usually or ""no-reply@"" + serverConfigurationService.getServerName())

One of our instructors has a strong use case for making changes to the titles of student folders within the Drop Box tool, yet we've recently discovered that only admin users (and not Maintain users) are able to do this.

We brought this issue to Longsight for investigation and Matt Jones discovered some logic and commenting (below) that helped to inform us of why Maintain users were being obstructed.
{noformat}
      // don't allow changing names of system-provided dropbox folders 
      // (maintainer's dropbox root and access-user's dropbox root)

    //Admin can always change dropbox folder name
    if (isAdmin) {
      allowed = true

*Discussion*

Drop Box folders for Access users are created on demand as these users enter a course site. Manually changing the titles of folders via Edit Details does not change the permissions of individual folders, though all the human users involved would then lose the benefit of the titles being lined up with the name of the user for whom they were created.

Though the above is the case, we assume that the few instructors that wish to manually change titles of Drop Box folders have a convention in mind and will maintain the points of reference needed to continue to connect a folder with a changed title to the appropriate user.

Should instructors/Maintain users be able to change the titles of Drop Box folders, or is this practice too risky?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SAK-39497,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,,,,"0|10bj20:",9223372036854775807,,Please add a Test Plan here.,,,Not started,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent UX Testing, most participants indicated confusion over the presentation of two default criteria with different point values. They usually ended up modifying one of the criteria and deleting the other. In particular, some participants objected to the terminology used for the various levels (i.e. inadequate) and/or the point values (i.e. zero) as not being pedagogically sound/appropriate. Participants were also frustrated by the fact that adding a new criterion kept defaulting back to the original one which they did not want to use.

Including only one default criterion would simplify the interface. In addition, allowing the ability for a user to designate an individually customized criterion as the “default” for their site would reduce the work required when creating new rubrics.

Queries against this table therefore do a full table scan.

A new feature will be coming soon which uses this data to determine an engagement score for a student based on their activity in a site for their local time. 

This data is not available through sitestats as sitestats aggregates the events per day/per site and does not include student info. Events are also not localised to a student's local timezone (for example if I had a server in Australia and a user in New York generated an event at 9pm, the event would be recorded for the next day).

If sitestats did collect this data then it would just be like a copy of the sakai_event table anyway and would likely result in an additional database write for every event that occurred.

This ticket adds a multi column index to the sakai_event table. This does not significantly impact the writes onto this table. In any case, the writes are batched up and run in a separate thread, as per the ClusterEventTracking service.

The sample PL/SQL app below generates thousands of inserts and batches them up for commit. See results below. 

*Sample app:*
{code}
DECLARE
  x NUMBER;
  y NUMBER;
  j NUMBER := 5; -- the number of loops
  k NUMBER := 100; -- the number of inserts per loop
BEGIN

  FOR i IN 1..j LOOP
  
    -- reset counters each time to get a better spread of data
    x := 1;
    y := 1;

    -- insert a bunch of data, commit each loop
    FOR j IN 1..k LOOP
      INSERT INTO sakai_event (event_id, event_date, event, ref, context, session_id, event_code) 
      VALUES (sakai_event_seq.nextval, sysdate, 'fake.event', 'fake.ref', 'fake.site' || x, 'fake.sessionid' || y, 'x');
    
      -- every 20 events increment the site_id
      IF MOD(j,20) = 0 THEN
        x := x + 1;
      END IF;
    
      -- every 5 inserts, increment the user_id
      IF MOD(j,5) = 0 THEN
        y := y + 1;
      END IF;
    END LOOP;
    COMMIT;
  END LOOP;   
END;
/

{code}

*Results:*
+100 inserts+
Without index, 0.020s
With index, 0.028s

+500 inserts+
Without index, 0.09s

Without index, 0.75s
With index, 0.76s

+100,000 inserts+
Without index, 14s
With index, 17s

Typically, the number of events would be on the lower end of these results as the check runs every 5 seconds to insert the current batch.

Query that uses the index:
{code}
SELECT 
  e.event
, e.context
, s.session_user
, e.event_date
FROM sakai_event e
JOIN sakai_session s
  ON e.session_id = s.session_id
WHERE s.session_user = :user_id
AND e.context = :site_id
AND e.event_date BETWEEN TO_DATE(:start_of_day, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') AND TO_DATE(:end_of_day, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS')
ORDER BY e.event_date ASC
{code}

Without the index and 1.6 million rows in the event table, the cost of this query is about 2000 times more than with it.

At institutions they can have a 100 million rows easily and performance would not be good.
Also some are accustomed to truncating this often so again you would be missing data. Some do this as often as every 2 weeks or a month.

I would not use this table and formulate your own plan for acquiring this kind of info.

One thing I have thought of doing was to move all the events into elastic search where they can actually be used for something good, like what your trying to do here. 
The way it exists now this table is just a log and shouldn't be used for querying.","21-Mar-2016 14:19;jonespm;[~ern] I think you're being too generous with the data retention period. Most institutions I know of migrate and truncate this table nightly, there's not going to be any way to get real time data out of this. All of this data for most places is retained in a data warehouse where it can be processed in the background and handled by some system independent of Sakai.

It feels like anything that wants to get something like engagement score will move the data out of Sakai through something like Tin Can and Caliper. And then a completely separate project than Sakai would be used for the visualization (Apereo even) like Student Success Plan and the Learning Analytic Processor. 

Otherwise this isn't going to work with a very large amount of Sakai schools.","21-Mar-2016 14:55;steve.swinsburg;That's what I considered also, however this data will be collected on a daily basis and then no longer needed. 100M rows is a bit of a stretch, see figures in KNL-575. But agree that it is a log. Have you guys got more info on the Tin Can/Elastic search approach you mentioned? 

Maybe in the interim the data could be replicated to a separate reporting table every 6 hours or so and even denormalised (replace session_id with the user_id to avoid the additional join to sakai_session). Then the data could be truncated once it has been used.","22-Mar-2016 08:41;ern;So ElasticSearch is a full fledged search engine and everything you do is JSON based so you can query right from the front end.

I was thinking for the event data a time based approach to storing event data in ES that would be immediately available to query and is fast, see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/time-based.html

If this sounds like something your interested in we should discuss it more?","22-Mar-2016 09:22;plukasew;I'm working on local modifications right now to collect a subset of this data in the SiteStats database. Essentially, it will record the full event data for every event that SiteStats counts. The goal is to expose this extra detail in the SiteStats tool, so you can click on the event count and actually see the individual events with the proper timestamp and possibly retrieve additional info about the event via Sakai api calls (ie. find out the name of the assignment that was submitted to for an asn.submit event).

We keep data in the sakai_event table for 30 days. At our institution this results in about 35 million records in this table. Of these, maybe only half are of interest to SiteStats (are tied to a site and session). There is so much noise in this table I doubt even with indexing it would be worthwhile.

We'll be releasing the collection phase of the modifications in May, but the UI is going to take some more work because of performance concerns.","22-Mar-2016 21:12;steve.swinsburg;@Paul, that could be useful, interested to see how you get on. What's the approach for managing the increased db writes for the events you are collecting? Also, is it threaded?
@Earle, we've actually culled the list of events down considerably so I think we are just going to go with an event listener approach for now, and then can look at Paul's backend and see if we want to swap it out. One of the challenges with time based data is getting the data localised to the student, not the server, as the events currently are. Would be interested to have a chat about this though.","23-Mar-2016 08:26;plukasew;We use the aggregator job here to process the events, not the event listener, and we have a separate sitestats database, so it should have little to no impact on users. Currently we're processing 50,000 events at a time, and it takes about 2 minutes at most. I don't anticipate a huge increase in processing time at first to add writing to the new table, but as the table grows and updating the indices becomes more costly, it could be a problem.

As a result of talking about KNL-811 it was suggested that the BaseEmailService should be decoupled from the current request and so that duplicate emails not be sent when a browser or other failure occurs.

The feature should include a way to track a UI request to send and track an email. For example if a ticket was generated and when email is sent is linked with the ticket then the tool can monitor the status of the email. This would also help prevent tools from trying to request duplicate emails be sent as the service would recognize based on the ticket if that email was already processed.

If a user lands on the resource picker and decides to cancel this operation, there is no “Cancel” button immediately presented, like there was in Sakai 11. See CancelButton_Sakai11.png.

In case this omission might have been intentional, note that for subpages the links in the Lessons breadcrumb trail do not suffice for performing a cancel event. Those links force the user to navigate away from the page that the user was previously on.
h2. Styling & Behavior for ‘Add’ Dropdowns

The styling for the “Add” dropdown menus for each folder seems to be missing, given the appearance of list bullets. See CurrentStylingForAddDropdowns.png.

Add a draggable deletion marker,SAK-37429,71406,New Feature,OPEN,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project.

Add a control that reintroduces a draggable deletion marker within the stack of page items, as had been used in Sakai 2.9. It serves initially as a dividing line between the items already on the page versus the items just copied over from another page. The activation and deactivation of this draggable deletion marker could be controlled with a labeled checkbox or a more prominent switch like the mock-up shown in InsertDeletionMarker.png. This placement of this control could be above the right-side panel which stores the page items marked for deletion.

*Details / Use Case*
At our institution where we’re currently using Sakai 2.9, we make extensive use of the feature in Lessons for copying content across pages. This process is illustrated in the following help document, [How do I copy items from one Lessons page to another?|https://sakai.plu.edu/portal/help/TOCDisplay/content.hlp?docId=howdoicopyitemsfromalessonspage] This process is specifically useful when an instructor wants to copy just one or a handful of items at a time. 

A common scenario for us is to copy a few pre-formatted rich text blocks stored in a designated “template” page that’s hidden from students. LessonsTemplatePage_Sakai2.9.png depicts a portion of such a page. The depicted stack of distinct rich-text blocks serve as reusable “callout” boxes used in Lessons pages throughout the course to draw attention to particular tips, activities, or optional sub-lessons. From the template page, an instructor would commonly copy one or two such callout boxes to add to a page under construction. (For what it’s worth, LessonsTemplatePage_Sakai12.png depicts how we would likely adapt the same kind of template to Sakai 12, where we make use of the new sections/columns whose background colors can be readily set by instructors.)  

The method for reordering and pruning page items to be copied from one page to another was partially redesigned with the advent of Sakai 10. Significant changes inherent to this redesign include: 
 * The draggable deletion marker used in 2.9-- see DeletionMarker_2.9.png --was removed.
 * Delete buttons (red X’s) were added to each of the draggable page items. Clicking the ‘X’ moves the item to a panel on the right.
 * Page items could also be dragged to the panel on the right, marking them for deletion.

The addition of the last two features noted above are very useful for pruning out a few items while keeping the rest. However, when attempting to copy only a few items and discard the rest, especially when the page from which to copy contains 10 or more items, the amount of clicking and dragging it takes to prune out what you don’t want is much more cumbersome than it was in Sakai 2.9. 

To illustrate this more concretely, consider the case where an instructor wants to only copy two items from a page that contains 10 or more items. Compare the actions that would need to be taken in Sakai 2.9 versus Sakai 12 to complete this task. In Sakai 2.9, the instructor would need to click and drag the two items above the deletion marker and then click ‘Save”. See ReorderCopiedItems_2.9.png. In Sakai 12, the instructor must instead click or drag each of the 8+ other page items to prune them out in order to leave the two items the instructor wants to copy. See ReorderCopiedItems_12.png. Thus, for this use case, there is a decrease in efficiency in transitioning from Sakai 2.9 to 12.

One possible way to improve the efficiency of copying page items in Sakai 12 would be add another control that reintroduces a draggable deletion marker within the stack of page items, as had been used in Sakai 2.9. It serves initially as a dividing line between the items already on the page versus the items just copied over from another page. The activation and deactivation of this draggable deletion marker could be controlled with a labeled checkbox or a more prominent switch like the mock-up shown in InsertDeletionMarker.png. This placement of this control could be above the right-side panel which stores the page items marked for deletion.

The appearance of the control to activate and deactivate the draggable deletion marker could be reserved solely for the copying process. (I don’t foresee benefits to reintroducing the draggable deletion marker to the Reorder view outside the process for copying page items. In other words, when clicking Reorder for normal use-- to reorder page items that already exist within a particular page-- I wouldn’t recommend reintroducing this draggable deletion marker. The other newer controls are sufficient.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"23-Jun-2017 17:11;hornersa;DeletionMarker_2.9.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/47690/DeletionMarker_2.9.png","23-Jun-2017 17:11;hornersa;InsertDeletionMarker.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/47689/InsertDeletionMarker.png","23-Jun-2017 17:11;hornersa;LessonsTemplatePage_Sakai12.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/47691/LessonsTemplatePage_Sakai12.png","23-Jun-2017 17:11;hornersa;LessonsTemplatePage_Sakai2.9.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/47692/LessonsTemplatePage_Sakai2.9.png","23-Jun-2017 17:11;hornersa;ReorderCopiedItems_12.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/47687/ReorderCopiedItems_12.png","23-Jun-2017 17:11;hornersa;ReorderCopiedItems_2.9.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/47688/ReorderCopiedItems_2.9.png",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,LSNBLDR-825,,,"0|109ixs:",9223372036854775807,,,,,Not started,,,,,,,"26-Jun-2017 14:14;ncaidin;Is the essence of this request the paragraph:

When I click on it, it opens a player in a new window. It doesn't download anything. The purpose of hiding download links is to make it more difficult for students to download the underlying file. What's the use case for preventing them from opening a player in a full window? The concern is that depending upon screen size and player, videos might not work well in embedded form, and would work better in a separate window.

The open in new window link simply creates a new window with https://media.upv.es/player/?id=98effade-26ef-a346-ac43-d06f43b28564 in it. I don't know why the recording shows it going into an editor, but I'm not sure that's something I could prevent.

It should even work most of the time, as groups are stored internally as ID numbers, not names. However there are situations when the user does something unexpected where we have to recreate the group, and we can end up with extra groups if the old and new names aren't the same. That's why I didn't internationalize the name. I didn't want the name to change if you change languages. So changing it could result in duplicate groups in some odd situations, e.g. if more than one lesson uses the same assignment or quiz and one of the groups was created with the old name but the other doesn't exist yet. I'm not sure whether this is a serious enough problem to prevent making the change.

Incidentally, it is a feature that the groups are visible to the instructor. That can let them make exceptions if they need to.

","26-Jun-2013 12:09;jmariano;HI, there was a message on the list from Daniel Merino addressing this concern:


We are very concerned about Lessons creating groups to manage several
contents with prerequisites. These groups, which start with ""Access:""
string, are visible in every group-aware tool (Resources, Assignments,
MessageCenter, Forums, Roster...) and we think that they can be very
confusing for our users.

Is there any way to disable the creation of these groups? We would like
to avoid them even if we have to sacrifice some Lessons features.

http://collab.sakaiproject.org/pipermail/sakai-dev/2013-June/023346.html","26-Jun-2013 12:11;jmariano;My comment on this is:

We think that 'Internal groups' created by Lessons should not be treated as regular groups in Sakai because they will be displayed in all Group aware tools. Those groups seems to be for internal use in Lessons.

To make it easier to understand, I will compare it to what SignUp is doing in its latest version. It allows a user to create groups so that they can be used in all other tools. A user will need to choose:

     Create groups for timeslots      [ ] Yes, create a group for each timeslot that can be managed via Site Info > Manage Groups

Then, groups are created and can be used all over Sakai. When that option is not selected, groups from signup are not displayed anywhere else.

I understand that groups are displayed intentionally, should that be controlled via sakai.properties?? Or by the user, like SignUp is doing??","12-Aug-2013 05:40;daniel.merino;Groups visibility issue is addressed at https://jira.sakaiproject.org/browse/LSNBLDR-264",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Empower instructor to know the progress of each student within Lessons and ability to export key data to CSV or Excel for additional analysis.

*BACKGROUND*

Lessons is awesome. It's a rich tool with so many options. Instructors want to know more about the progress of student engagement within Lessons, and have options to export data and feedback for analysis.

*DASHBOARD*

Similar to how the Checklist feature has a grid to see which students have marked which items, a page list can show which students have visited different pages (similar to how each person can go to the Index of Pages and see which pages they have visited or not).

*EXPORT*

There is valuable information in Lessons, such as answers to the ""Question,"" ""Comments,"" and ""Checklist"" features.  We have had instructors ask for a way to easily export this data in bulk for analysis in Excel or other tools. Via whichever dashboard or statistics page within Lessons, there should be an option to export not only status data, but also the individual responses from students in questions, comments, and checklists.
----
I understand that there is a feature in Statistics (Site Stats) that attempts to aggregate Lessons data (SAK-29709). The feature is currently broken, however (SAK-33432). Also, as far as I know, it doesn't allow export of individual student question answers, comments, etc. Whether fixing and enhancing the Site Stats process or creating a new Lessons feature that looks and feels like other Lessons tools, I leave that to the community.  Most instructors would intuitively attempt to export or download data within Lessons, so at minimum, an option to download student engagement data would be helpful in Lessons.

If we find the web page, then we add a link to it in Lessons. Otherwise there's nothing to show in Lessons, so we give that warning message.

The intent was never to show some kind of file browser into the contents of the ZIP file. Rather, the idea was that someone would be using a desktop tool that prepares content. A lot of those tools output a set of web pages in a ZIP file with index.html as an index into them. E.g. it used to be that Powerpoint would output a presentation as a set of web pages (though I'm not sure current versions still do that). There was an index.html at the top level. It's actually not that hard to display a browser. Sakai has a URL that would do that.

----
I belong to the department of Chemistry of the Universidad Politécnica de Valencia (Spain), and we want to use the tool ""Tests & Quizzes: Create and manage online assessments"" in our courses. We are dealing with around 500 students first and second semester courses. 

As you know, laboratory sessions are an important part of chemistry courses, and we thought to use Quizzes for our students to make sure they have the concepts needed to perform correctly these sessions. The idea would be to use this tool to asses the previous learning in the 6 sessions that would perform the (more or less) 20 lab groups in each semester. So a student would perform his test previous to his laboratory session.
 
This would be something similar to what the Department of Chemistry, University of California - Davis (UC Davis) is using, and I quote from their web resources ""On Line Pre-laboratory Quizzes: Each 2 point pre-lab quiz must be completed at least 1 hour prior to attending the student's scheduled lab class.""

This semester we have started to use these quizzes with a small group of 100 students (4 laboratory groups) but we have a problem, since students have laboratory sessions in different days/weeks, we would like to specify a different deadline for each laboratory group, this means that we would like to merge the following tools (see image, in pink): ""Fecha límite"" (deadline date) and ""Examen publicado para grupos seleccionados"" (published for selected groups). In this way we would be able to create only one quiz per laboratory session and indicate the deadline for each laboratory group; instead of creating one quiz for each laboratory group (this would mean at least 20 quizzes for each of the 6 laboratory sessions, i.e. around 120 quizzes in each semester!!).

Thank you for your interest, 
Patricia Noguera.

Instructor needs access to each students' unique test experience for integrity check ,SAK-34780,70724,New Feature,OPEN,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project. Please follow the <a href=""https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/MGT/Sakai+Jira+Guidelines"">Jira Guidelines</a>",http://sakaiproject.org,Major,,samigoteam,lcira,lcira,31-Mar-2017 13:09,17-Apr-2018 08:08,18-Feb-2021 03:39,,10.5,10.7,11.5 [Tentative],12.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Tests & Quizzes (Samigo),,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,"SHORT DESCRIPTION: When reviewing student submissions for a multiple choice/randomized answer quiz, Instructors want to be able to see a snapshot of each student's quiz answer order and their selections in case an integrity issue arises.

EXPLANATION AND SCENARIO:
Scenario: Instructor suspects students are cheating on his random-answer multiple choice quizzes. He believes a facilitator took the quiz early, writing down all the answers (1 = D, 2 = A, 3 = E and so on). Going on a hunch based on previous events, he believes the cheating students then took that answer sheet and answered using the same letter selections (instead of bothering to read the answer choices) without realizing that the answers were randomized. 

He needs to confirm whether all of their answer selections match those of their facilitator, which would be statistically improbable with enough randomized answer choices on a quiz of 20 questions (since the correct answer could land as choice A for one student and B for another, C for yet another.)

As it is now, Samigo has three different views of a randomized test:

1. *Edit screen for quiz*, which displays original answer order
2. *Student feedback screen*, which shows order student encountered during test as well as which answer he chose (if enabled) - only the student can see this
3. *Instructor review of student answers* (Published copy of quiz > Scores > click on student’s name), which shows entire quiz with student’s answer selection BUT which does NOT correspond to the exact letter he chose

Problem: As it is currently, an instructor will not be able to see the unique, randomized presentation of answers for each individual student. When an instructor views student answers via the Scores screen (option 3, above), he will notice that each students’ quiz appears to have presented answer options in the exact same order. Student A’s quiz will appear to be exactly the same as Student B and Student C - and, oddly,  this order isn’t the same as was in the original quiz as created (visible through choice 1, above). This screen doesn’t seem to correspond to anything else!

Solution: The instructor needs access to the version of the quiz as it is presented to each student to truly see which letter they selected in their answer. This order is preserved via the individual student’s feedback screen. How can we make this screen be the one accessible to the instructor through Scores > student?

*Current behavior:* When a quiz has randomized answers or questions, when the instructor first select a student's name from _Total Scores_, the instructor's individual student _Scores_ screen for every student is populated with that same random order (I understand this to be in the ""delivery bean"", but may be misunderstanding what a developer explained to me about how it works).  Reviewing subsequent students, the instructor always sees the same order and NOT what each student saw during the take.

It would be a new feature to change this behavior to allow instructor's scores screens to mirror student feedback screens for students on randomized quizzes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One workaround may be to not let the teacher see the the actual answers until say 3 answers have been submitted and let the ID for the submissions be randomized. Then the teachers will have a hard time to follow the individuals. 

This problem is especially obvious for small serveys, but if a teacher follows the submissions in real-time and the students doesn't submit exactly the same time, it should be possible to track down large serveys too.

The other way to handle such cases is the one you mentioned of allowing individual students to retake specific tests, and this may be what you have in mind here.  If so, we can adapt the text for that:

""This feature would allow faculty to reject individual tests and quizzes, allowing only specific students to retake the tests.  This option would be most useful in tests designed primarily for information-gathering about the limits of a student's abilities.

Note: This feature request is different than the current ""allow retake"" option since the student's previous responses would still be there when the student ""retakes"" the assessment.  The student would be able to modify and add to their responses and then resubmit their assessment.

When authoring a question in SAMigo, the ability to provide question-level feedback is a default setting for all question types. When authoring a question, the general question-level feedback field is located at the bottom of the page. 

To provide selection-level feedback (e.g., a, b, or c for a multiple choice question), or to provide both question-level and selection-level feedback, one would need to change the setting under Feedback > Feedback Authoring to  Question-Level Feedback.

From an IU jira:

------------------------------
On the submit confirmation screen, if the student taking the test clicks the button a second time, you see the data discrepancy error.
See the video here: http://screencast.com/t/0qJ8FdpMQ

To reproduce:
Enter a test as a student.
Take the test and go all the way to the last question.
On the last question page, click the Submit button. You see the submit confirmation screen, with another submit button.

When you click the button on this page, the screen seems to lag for several seconds. If you wait, it will eventually refresh. BUT many students will not wait; they will assume that something is wrong and click the button again. At that point (on the second click) the data discrepancy error appears.
------------------------------

The patch modifies the javascript to create a new, disabled button on the screen to give the illusion the button is disabled, when really it just disappears.  This also ensures that the button is only ever clicked once and the important issue to address. :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"07-Dec-2011 09:06;gjthomas@iu.edu;samigo.patch;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/29374/samigo.patch",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,36936,,,SAM-1514,,,"0|107k14:",44072,,,,,Not started,,,,,,,"07-Dec-2011 11:31;ktsao;As this is an issue has to be fixed, I am willing to merge your patch.

A big advantage, especially since ""exceptions"" settings are not currently part of the latest settings redesign, is that two assessments can be associated with the same gradebook item (if I'm understanding this correctly), and the most recent score overwrites previous ones. This would allow for creating an ""exceptions"" assessment targeted to particular users, but without the problem of a new gradebook item getting created for all site participants.

For the gradebook item name/weight setting, I wonder if a better functionality would be to mirror how it's handled in Assignments 1: if you have a gradebook with categories/weighted categories, you'll see a dropdown menu to select the category. I'm not sure about the usefulness of the item weight setting, since a) gradebook integration with other tools requires points-based entry, and b) item weight is determined by category weight (not sure how it works here).","25-Jun-2013 11:20;lgekeler;The Use Case we've discovered for this feature started as an alternative for a group of instructors doing high stakes testing who wanted complete randomization funcationality. Since we know from our High Stakes BOF at the Aperero in San Diego that many of us are supporting high stakes exams for large numbers of students where Instructors want to utilize high degrees of randomization and we may continue to have performance issues with the current tool, the alternative of creating multiple versions of the same test and assigning student groups to the alternate tests has surfaced.

IF, the work-around for highly randomized tests generated from large question pools is in fact this practice, then the alternate versions of the test should all be linked to the same column in the gradebook. We at the University of Notre Dame would like to see this feature. Unfortunately we're not currently staffed to provide developers. We are an ANI (formerly rSmart) client. BTW, thanks for taking a look at this, Jim Mezzanotte! I'll ask Orla if ANI would consider putting development time into this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 * any time (immediate)

Some thought would have to go into how the student would see the feedback. What the faculty really want is when they hit ""continue"" it would show them the feedback.

IMO, the folders/grouping should only be available in the instructor's _Working Copies_ and _Published Copies_ (not for students) because it could be confusing for students to drill down into folders to access quizzes, especially if the availability dates are such that the students won't see too many quizzes at once.

I'm on holidays until September. That's not a problem to comment on this but I'm out of the office and I cannot query my notes about it. :(

David","05-Jan-2012 11:02;mclare;I just found this request/patch.   I'll add to the distinction between the proposed patch and the current export option.

In summary:

Export is missing Date (important for surveys, etc.) Role Adjustments and the Comment.
Total Scores is missing Part scores and the individual questions.

Maybe we need to improve Export?


Details:

Published Assessments -> Scores -> Total Scores screen provides the following:
Name	UserID	Role	Submit Date	Time	Score	Adjustment	Final Score	Comment for Student

Published Assessments -> Scores -> Export provides the following:
Submission Id  OR UserID	Part Scores ........  Final Score	Question 1...........

Export is missing Date (important for surveys, etc.) Role Adjustments and the Comment.
Total Scores is missing Part scores and the individual questions.

I believe the individual questions is why Export can take so long for larger sets, as reported here:  https://jira.sakaiproject.org/browse/SAM-827   SAM-827 has only raised the number of submissions Export can handle from about 200 to about 400 in our experience.

The ability to export without the question content in either location would solve the timeout issue identified in SAM-827 and some options on the Export page may be the ultimate solution.

The ability to export the submission date would be very useful, and the submission date is on the Total Scores page.

If the community thinks that a new interface to the Export panel to select what can be exported is the way to go I'd be happy to formalize the feature request and put a $20 (US or CDN) bounty in the form of iTunes/Amazon gift cards or a charitable donation.","13-Apr-2012 08:25;mclare;My promisses to put a $20 (US or CDN) bounty up in the form of iTunes/Amazon gift cards or a charitable donation still stands!

We can discuss at the next SAMigo working group meeting (04.17.12) and get feedback from working group members.

There is no way to retrieve the submission from the instructor's account. At present the only alternatives are:

1. If the quiz has not been retracted then an admin can su to the student and submit. This will, however change the submitted date so if the instructor needs to know when the student hit save this needs to be checked in the database first

As part of my teaching philosophy, I would like a student to learn from their mistakes in a tutorial session.

I have set up a Test & Quizzes with a numeric response with a pool of questions and *multiple* answers. I have set up the Grading and Feedback on Immediate Feedback.  

The student can do the test twice, and can then see after the first test where they went wrong in their calculations.

The only way that a student can see which off the answers are correct or incorrect is if select _Correct Response_.

The disadvantage of this is that a student then can see what the answer is, and then there is no point in this.

Please see the attached files for examples of where I selected _Correct response_.  One can clearly see which answers are correct.  Whilst with the other file, one has no idea where the error was.

I would like an option where one can see if an answer is correct or incorrect, but without the showing the +Answer key+.

We include the link to the survey in an email to the 25k students.

My reply is below each question:

>>Hi Raúl,
>>(1) Is possible by using a question pool.

That's right: If instructor wants to create an assessment by typing the questions' score only one time, he is able to do it by using a question              pool. However in this use case the instructor is forced to use a question pool and the random question order. So the instructor is not able to create an assessment by typing the questions' score only one time and authoring the questions one-by-one.

>>(2) This seems very difficult. I don't understand the use case for negative point values. If a question is worth 5 points, why does a student need to receive negative points as opposed to 0?

Because ""Multiple Choice,Single Correct"" and ""True False"" questions allow negative points so the students could get a negative score in these kind of questions.

It is the same use case than above: It would be useful to introduce the full assessment's negative point value in the assessment's configuration. This is possible by using a question pool too but in this use case the instructor is forced to use a question pool and the random question order.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In my subject, I need to use tables from which student need to interpolate values.  A single set of inputs is given, and various steps are marked in the problem to determine what steps the students understood correct.  

The tables values (for example steam tables) have sometimes very complex formulas and other times no formulas.  Thus programming them is not an option.

At this stage, I use numeric response.  I generate for example 20 of the same question with different inputs to simulate_ Calculated questions_ option.

To generate the questions, I use an external software to generate the answers.  The answers are then copied in excel, that I can create a sentence, and finally copied in Sakai to form the pool of questions.  This takes a very long time, and have made several errors in excel between the various inputs and outputs.

The idea at the end is to have a test bank of questions, which the students then practice to determine if the understand the work correctly.  

I would like to have an option in calculated questions where an input value is given and then another value can obtain from the table as part of the calculation steps.  I can then automate the questions and have more questions, which will save time.  At this stage, a large part of the subject is based on the use of tables, and thus this will help me tremendously.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

"samigo: feature request:Partial credit for Multiple Choice, Multiple Correct questions",SAK-34716,82008,New Feature,OPEN,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project. Please follow the <a href=""https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/MGT/Sakai+Jira+Guidelines"">Jira Guidelines</a>",http://sakaiproject.org,Major,,maintenanceteam,rainribbon,rainribbon,29-Jan-2018 13:23,17-Apr-2018 08:08,18-Feb-2021 03:39,,11.2,11.3,11.4,11.5 [Tentative],12.0,19.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,Tests & Quizzes (Samigo),,,,,,,1,authoring,delivery,feedback,MCMultiple,Scoring,,,,"This is a request for a new feature: Partial credit for the _Multiple Choice/Multiple Selection_ question type. 

In this new *Partial Credit* option, scoring for the question would function similar to that of _Fill in the Blank_ and _Matching_ questions.  The *total point value* of the question is divided by the *number of answer options, BOTH correct and incorrect*.

Following the logic of the proposed scoring method, if at least *one* correct answer has been selected, a student will get partial credit for either selecting the correct answer or correctly ignoring wrong answers.

More details and an example:

The existing _Multiple Choice, Multiple Correct_ scoring option of *Right Less Wrong* is unfavorable to many instructors.  In *Right Less Wrong* scoring, the *total point value* of the question is *divided by the number of Correct answers*.  Points are *subtracted* from the score for either failing to select a correct answer OR selecting an incorrect answer, with minimum point value of 0 if this would technically render the resulting score negative.

An instructor at UVA proposes the following new scoring option for _Multiple Choice, Multiple Correct_ *Partial Credit* (apologies for the bulleted list - I couldn't make JIRA give me a numbered list with letters instead of numbers.  ""Correct minus Incorrect"" is a renamed ""Right Less Wrong"" question - no one understood what ""Right Less Wrong"" meant):
{quote}As an example, imagine the following question was worth 1.5 points. Each correct answer would be worth +0.25 points to the overall score, and each correctly ignored wrong answer would also be worth +0.25 points:

Which of the following are animals? 
 * A. Dog
 * B. Cat
 * C. House
 * D. Mug
 * E. Pig
 * F. Monkey

So, if a student selected A, B, and C, he/she would get +0.25 for A, +0.25 for B, and +0.25 for D (since it was correctly ignored), for a total of 0.75 on the positive side. Though C is an incorrect response, in this case we are working with partial credit (for a new feature), not right less wrong, therefore we don't deduct any points for this answer. Therefore the final result is .75.

Essentially, each answer is systematically graded on a correct/incorrect basis and is worth a value equal to the point total for the question divided by the number of choices.

The difference between this method and the current ‘Correct minus Incorrect’ is subtle, so it’s understandable if there is not enough impetus to make an actual change, but I appreciate your help!
{quote}
Based on comments below, I'm adding another example of the proposed scoring method to hopefully clarify:

If a question with 3 possible answer options is worth 6 points, each answer option is worth *2 points*.

The following are even numbers:
 * A. 1 (incorrect - you get 2 points if you do NOT select this answer)
 * B. 2 (correct - you get 2 points if you DO select this answer)
 * C. 4 (correct - you get 2 points if you DO select this answer)

||Student Selects||Student Scores||Why this Score?||
|B and C only|6 points|Full credit for selecting both right answers and ignoring the wrong one|
|A and B|2 points|+2 points for selecting B, but no points earned for ignoring A or selecting C.|
|A only|0 points|You didn't select any correct answers, only the wrong one.|
|Nothing selected|0 points|The question wasn't answered.  Even though ignoring the wrong answer would technically award points, points should only be awarded for correctly ignored wrong answers if at least one other answer is selected.|

The second row in the table above is where this proposed scoring method differs from Right Less Wrong. Because Right Less Wrong assigns points only to correct answers, awards points for selecting correct answers, and removes points for selecting incorrect answers, the student in Row 2 above would get *0 points* = +3 points earned for selecting the right answer, -3 points for selecting the wrong answer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SAK-34956,SAK-34904,SAK-34645,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,SAM-3348,,,"0|10bbg8:",9223372036854775807,,Please add a Test Plan here.,,,Not started,,,,,,,"05-Feb-2018 13:50;ncaidin;This does not seem complete to me because the student should be getting a -.25 for selecting C) House, so the score should be .5 , correct?

Essentially in this example it seems that:
 * The total possible points is divided by the total number of possible answers to give the points per answer
 * Correct answers are awarded points if selected, or Zero if not selected
 * Incorrect answers are awarded points if selected, or negative points if not selected

 

If incorrect answers are not awarded negative points for choosing, then this just becomes a partial credit, right?

Also, I assume that the current algorithm is that the total possible points is divided by the total number of correct answers only, so in the example it would be 1.5 / 4 = .375 points and that that amount is subtracted when a wrong answer is selected, but that wrong answers are Zero if not selected. Correct answers are also Zero if not selected. Is that the current state?

 ","07-Feb-2018 08:23;rainribbon;That's right, the new scoring method proposed here is a form of *partial credit*.  Multiple choice, multiple selection questions do not currently have a partial credit option, only *right less wrong*.  Right less wrong *penalizes* students for selecting incorrect answers.  So, if you have a question with 3 answers as follows, worth 10 points:

A. Correct answer #1

B. Incorrect answer

C. Correct answer #2

Student correctly selects *A* and *C*, they get *10 points*.

Student selects *A* and *B*, they get *0* *points*. (*+5 points* for selecting one correct answer, *-5 points* for selecting wrong answer, 0 for failing to select the other correct answer).

Student selects *A*, *B*, and *C*, they get *5 points*. (*+10 points* for selecting both correct answers, *-5 points* for selecting wrong answer)

Instructor here wants the question to score as follows instead:

*10 points* total, *each answer option* is worth *3.33* *points*, thus:

A. Correct answer #1 - gives 3.33 points *if selected*

B. Incorrect answer * *- gives 3.33 points if *NOT selected*

C. Correct answer #2 - gives 3.33 points *if selected*.

Student selects *A* and *C*, they get *10 points*.

Student selects *A* and *B*, they get *3.33 points*.  This is because they EARN *3.33* for correctly selecting A, they do NOT lose or earn other points BECAUSE they selected B (wrong answer) and FAILED to select C (other correct answer).

Student selects *A*, *B*, and *C*, they get *6.66 points*.  Selecting both correct answers awards points for those, but they also selected a wrong answer so they don't get the additional 3.33 points for failing to select it.","07-Feb-2018 08:28;rainribbon;The problem is that with *right less wrong*, total points for the question are divided by the *number of CORRECT* answers.

The instructor wants INCORRECT answers and CORRECT answers to be counted equally instead, which is the case for ALL OTHER question types, such as Fill in the Blank and Matching.","07-Feb-2018 08:44;ncaidin;Okay, I updated the description but maybe I updated it incorrectly. You responded to my previous comment as ""that's right"" which I took to mean I was understanding it right. But reading this again it seems like you are not advocating to change Right less Wrong, but simple to allow Partial Credit on this question type, in addition to the existing Right Less Wrong option. ?

 ","07-Feb-2018 08:52;rainribbon;Yes, I'm advocating to *add* this *new* scoring type, to have a scoring method that makes the multiple choice, multiple selection question behave like other question types with multiple answers (fill in the blank and matching).

I'm not recommending to change the existing right less wrong scoring that instructors with whom I've spoken generally dislike.  I understand some institutions prefer to penalize students for selecting incorrect answers.","07-Feb-2018 14:31;lgekeler;I would like to see feature requests that reduce complexity, not increase it.

This new method suggested is more in accordance with other question types' scoring.  You earn points for each correct answer selected.  You earn points for each incorrect question NOT selected.

Here's another example of the proposed scoring method:

If a question with 3 possible answer options is worth 6 points, each answer option is worth *2 points*.

The following are even numbers:

FYI - our Production project in Jira is for reporting installations of Sakai in use at institutions around the world, not for reporting issues.

I've moved your issue to Samigo, but have not yet put on the security flag (because it might prevent you from seeing this). 

Could you please write to sakai-security@apereo.org and include which version of Sakai you are using and the step-by-step steps to reproduce the issue, and why you think it is a security issue?

I'm not understanding why this is a security issue and perhaps more details will help.

","26-Apr-2016 15:39;lcira;[~tgolightly@kcu.edu] I think you have a good case here. I think that, if an instructor were worried that future students would benefit from a current student having access to the questions on their test, the instructor would like the option to simply display a grade and comments on grade as the only feedback for the quiz. 

If the Instructor were to choose ""Only Release Student's Assessment Scores"", the student should be able to see the comments entered in the Total Scores screen.

For example, I have several situations where students have to check properties of specific binary relations - the properties to check for are the same, but the relations should be randomly drawn from a pool. 

I am currently doing this via a random draw from a question pool that has each relation listed as a separate ""multiple choice/multiple correct - multiple selection"" question. However, this messes up the scoring (the number of satisfied properties endogenously determines the weight for each correct answer). I'd much rather have a ""part"" for each relation, define the relation in the part description, and then ask students to evaluate each property with the ""true/false"" question type. (This would ensure that I can give equal weight to each property that's correctly assessed.) However, to maintain randomization, I would then have to be able to randomize over these _parts_ rather than just over the individual questions. Does this make sense?

If it's not too much to ask for, I think this feature could generally be useful to instructors who try to generate some variants in their quizzes, and would greatly improve the scoring flexibility without having to add further question types to an already long list. Does it sound feasible?

Additionally, in Samigo, someone may have entered a large number of grades for a quiz before attempting to save, so these could be lost if an interruption in internet connection happens between the warning message and second save click.  You also have to scroll all the way to the bottom of the page in order to save scores - keyboard accessibility problem if you're returned to the top of the screen for an error message before you can save (that said, we should probably have an update button at the top of the screen too).

-----------------------------
Original Description:
Assignments, Tests & Quizzes (Samigo), and Gradebook currently store and display point-based assessment values in different maners.  The recent discussion in the email thread in the ""Sakai DG: Assessment Tools"" illustrates why this is important and suggests appropriate resolutions.  Exisiting assessment tools and any new related tools should conform as best as possible to a standard approach to point-based storage and display.  

In particular, the developing consensus for storing point-based assessments values appears to be doubles.  By storing with as much percision as possible, then round-off errors are less likely to generate confusion for students and instructors.

For the display of points, the developing consensus is for two decimal places.  This will help also help reduce confusion related to round-off errors.  For example, 0.33 or 0.67 perhaps more clearly indicate you received one-third or two-thirds of a point, respectively, on an assessment item.  A desire for configuring the number of decimal places, at the system-wide and/or site-wide levels, has also been expressed; as has the desire not to allow such configuration.","24-Feb-2006 16:17;lfernandez@weber.edu;Ready for Voting","09-Nov-2007 11:49;oheyer;Assigned open feature requests to Lance since current GB development is in IU's court.","21-Oct-2008 02:22;jean-francois.leveque@upmc.fr;New feature",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In other words, if a user views Submissions, then clicks ""Questions"", they see a list of clickable question numbers, but in front of those question numbers, there should be a selector (pulldown or set of radio buttons or tabs) with the filter options:
- Show all questions
- Show ungraded questions

 I might even go so far as to say that ""Show ungraded questions"" is selected by default.","16-Dec-2013 06:43;martinr@acaweb.org;Just to add further credence to this idea, one of the faculty in our LAMP Consortium has independently suggested a similar improvement.  In an e-mail to me, he said, ""It would be helpful if there were some way for the grader to see which questions have been updated (i.e., graded), and which have NOT been reviewed/updated/graded yet. Maybe some kind of on-off mark on the ""questions"" page saying to highlight graded questions.""  I know that isn't quite what is suggested here, but the suggestion in SAM-1370 would probably meet the need just as well.

He also said, ""When grading a test question by question, at the top and bottom of each page, there should be a ""save and move to next question"" option, like in the Assignments and Gradebook tools. It's rather annoying to have to ""update"" at the bottom, wait for that to process, and THEN click on the next question (and wait for THAT page to load).""  Many of our LAMP consortium schools don't have the best bandwidth available, so every browser interaction back to the server adds load they'd like to avoid if possible.

It's not. I have a faculty member who has 29 sections of a 1000 person course. He has prepared a test in a test area using a bunch of random draw from pool. He now needs to put the assessment into the 29 sections. He was expecting to export it and import it into the 29 sections. He's about the get a very nasty surprise.

Furthermore, what happens when we need to move an assessment from one course to another? *EVERY* object in the system has to be exportable and moveable.

1) The pools themselves need to be exportable and importable, so we can pass responsbility to another faculty member, among other things.

2) The questions using the pools need to be.

The original 517 answer said basically that it was a hard problem. I'm willing to accept a subset. I'd be happy if we could export an assessment that pointed to a pool, and have it import only if the same pools already exist. I.e. what would export and import would be just the pointers to the pools.

Of course that presupposes that export and import of pools will work, but I believe that's under way, right?

Until Sakai has robust groups support, we can't add this functionality. 

This is not to say that we don't want export/import for QPs, but the solution above is priority for us. We would welcome a proposal from a SEPP member to contribute code for export/import for QPs.","29-Sep-2006 12:57;lijwilso;I understand the issue that you're stating and agree that it must be addressed in some manner to allow successful assessment sharing among sections.

Some good news is that I have versions of 'Import Question Pool' working for locally for me in both Sakai v2.1 and 2.2.x. Both code sets are pending review and QA before they can be moved to trunk or maintenance, however. I cannot give you a release estimate yet.

This new feature will not resolve your original problem because as you've stated, exporting an assessment with any question pool random draw results in the entire pool of questions being exported within the assessment. This will also be an issue for site archival from one quarter/semester to another. The solution might require a new item/question type in the qti code that specifies the random draw and pool information.  I'll include this concept in my QTI studies to see if there is an existing model in the documentation.

One advantage of the current design is that I have been able to export an assessment with random draw from one user's pool and import that xml file as a question pool for another user. So question pool sharing will be available between user's with this technique when the import code is released.

The export question pool issue is bigger because of the possibility of multiple levels of subpools. We need to determine the best model for handling this issue prior to coding. I will also bring this up during our migration talks at WG-Migration.
","05-Oct-2006 12:24;lijwilso;Currenlty functionality where an export of an assessment with a pool draw question generates the entire pool in the export is connected to import issues.

As a benefit, by exporting an entire pool from a single draw question, the generated XML may be handed off to another faculty member as a solution to 'sharing'. 
If or when this function is changed, we need to ensure that another model for exporting question pools or sharing pools is in place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But the one 'loophole' is when the student submit for grading, click yes I'm sure, and click ""Continue"" once received confirmation. It then return you to a normal browser window. Which means if the invigilator does not pay attention the student can go and do 'other stuff'.

Would it be possible (as for example with Survey Monkey) to specify what the ""Continue"" button must do on submission. i.e. close window, or redirect to another URL.

When a student stops/losses connection a test and returns and selects the""Continue Assessment"" button the student is taken to the 1st question in the test. This behaviour is problematic (in terms of lost time) for the student taking a test with lots of questions. 

Preferred Behaviour
After the student selects the ""Continue Assessment"" button they are taken to the question of (or after) their last save
Note: this sort of assumes the layout is ""part per page"" or ""question per page"". Ideally if the layout was all ""questions on single page"" the page to return to the focus being on the last autosave question

In my subject, the calculations are very complex.  This means I have various inputs, with various calculated values.

A student can make a calculation error (finger fault) and this causes that the student does not receive any marks for the calculations further.

For example

A = 5
B = 8

C = A + B
D = C * A
E = D * B

A student calculated that the answer of C was 11 and thus the answer his or her D is 55.  This is incorrect, and the student receives no marks.

An option can be added that one take the answer of C and uses it to calculate D.  If this is correct the student may get then a reduced mark, for example, 50% of answer D mark.  

If the answer of D is again wrong, a student can then get no marks.

I don't know up to which level this is possible.  For a start, I would suggest for every answer that is entered incorrect and the answer is used again, this should apply.

Thank you for your effort in this matter.

In the 1st case it seems completely counter intuitive for the answers to be available to the students WHILE they are doing the quiz. This is particularly problematic as it is the default on ""quick create"" (very commonly used by academics)

In the 2nd unless the teaching team has selected ""Grades sent to Gradebook"" then the results for the quiz are essentially ""lost"" (for the conventional use of a quiz: ie.student ""Smith"" got 10marks and student ""Weston"" to 15marks).  In addition, it makes it a much more convoluted process to manually add/alter marks for a participant after the due date (the marks must be sent to gradebook, the spreadsheet downloaded, altered and uploaded)

We request the defaults should change to  ""No feedback"" and ""Students' identities can be seen by graders"".

* Anonymous Grading as a default is confusing for new users. Having anonymous grading as an option is great, but it does not make sense as a default for the majority of users.

* Immediate Feedback can be confusing for new Sakai users (especially those without any training)... it seems better to default to conservative choices that have little chance of side effects (revealing answers to students).

This may seem like an easy change, but this setting is actually inside a filter the ""RequestFilter"" so there's no way to query this property without reading it directly which really isn't clean as far as code goes. At least not the same way quotas are stored. 

It's possible a quick fix solution could go in and read from these specific properties but to do it correctly would involve.adding a new method to server configuration service and have request filter use this method rather than have these values hard coded. Like
getUploadMax()
getUploadCeiling()

I see on Trunk (13.x) that the drag-and-drop interface provides a warning after someone has uploaded a file that is too large, and it lists the max file size.  Hopefully this means that the maximum file size is something that can be posted on the Check Quota page again?  For some reason, I thought that in Sakai 2.9 and earlier, that this information had been displayed on the Check Quota page.

I love Web Content and the changes that Dr. Chuck and others have implemented recently (2.9 and 10). To add make the process more efficient and to address a situation when someone adds a ""frame busting"" link as a Web Content tool, please consider adding a checkbox during Site Creation or Site Info/Edit Tools so that a new Web Content item can be pre-selected with ""open new window"" as an option.

RATIONALE
""EFFICIENCY"" -- For site creators or instructional designers that have to manage many sites, adding this one feature can save support, design, and instructional staff a lot of work and headaches. Why have them go to a separate link and take additional steps if we can add a checkbox at site creation or tool addition right then and there?

""FRAME-BUSTING BLUES"" -- Some sites don't like to be contained. If that site happens to be an HTTPS site, Web Content will try to embed as an iframe. The target site decides to break free, in the same window... and it creates a difficult loop for a majority of users who can never find the ""Edit"" button in Web Content to set the option for ""Open in new window."" Technically, it's possible by using the history and not going back one or sometimes even two steps, but to the first instance of Web Content.  This is not an obvious thing at all and produces an extra level of training and support overhead that could be greatly reduced by another place where a user can set the option that is outside of the Web Content tool.  (Will create a separate request for updating Page Order, too.)

There isn't that much tool configuration that site manage deals with, really just a few things like allowMultipleInstances (if you can have more than one of the same tool like Web or Lessons on a page)

The feature that added that was a pretty large change on SAK-7209. I feel like this would be a somewhat similar amount of work. Once someone was looking at it, they might think of other things that a tool might want to be able to configure on this page too, and allow for that to be a little more generic. 

Is a good idea though, and it can be hard to stop the popup busters. As an admin you can go into the admin Sites tool, edit the page and change the popup option there for the user.

Add an option for registration payment to joinable sites,SAK-33885,82021,New Feature,OPEN,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project.

In most cases, this is for professional development workshops, continuing education courses, or other types of self-enrollment classes that do not go through an enterprise registration system. 

Sakai already has a means of allowing users to browse and self-enroll in sites through the joinable sites feature. The only additional piece needed for a light-weight registration process is the option to require payment for course access upon joining. (For reference, Moodle has a feature similar to this using PayPal. [https://docs.moodle.org/29/en/Paypal_enrolment] )

At a high level, the registration/payment feature in Sakai would need to address the following requirements:
 * a way for an admin to specify account credentials for the institution (either via the GUI, or in sakai.properties) using a PCI compliant payment service 
 * an interface where an admin and/or instructor can designate that a site requires registration, as well as indicate the enrollment amount, dates, and max users
 * an interface to browse sites, view site descriptions, and select sites for enrollment (this is already provided by current joinable sites functionality) 
 * sites requiring registration should be indicated in some way - for example, with a dollar sign next to the join link
 * a way for students to register and enter payment information when they elect to join a site requiring registration 

Attached are a couple of mockups illustrating one possible way of adding the payment process into the existing joinable sites workflow. The first image shows the instructor view of the Site Info > Manage Access screen with some additional options for requiring registration. The second image shows the student view of a payment prompt after selecting to join a site that requires registration. In this workflow, once payment is entered and accepted, the student would then be enrolled in the site. 

Feedback on this proposed feature is welcomed. We would like to know if this is something that would interest the larger Sakai community.

It seems that our use of mysql is a bit more complex than dspace or matterhorn so as a result we have the following issues (at least) which cause the startup to fail using H2 in MYSQL mode.
1) Like HSQLDB, H2 does not support ""show columns from CONTENT_RESOURCE like 'FILE_SIZE'"" (or simply... it cannot handle the LIKE in SHOW COLUMNS...) and does not have an equivalent and compatible mechanism which can check if a column exists in a table (without becoming incompatible with MYSQL). I worked around this by running a check which pulls all the columns and then checks if any are equal to ""file_size"".

2) H2 cannot handle the length limits - TABLE_NAME(64), RECORD_ID(128) must be rewritten to drop the length limits.
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX SAKAI_LOCKS_INDEX ON SAKAI_LOCKS ( TABLE_NAME(64), RECORD_ID(128) );
I worked around this by removing the limits since we practically never actually exceed 64 and 128 chars in the data.

3) H2 does not support COMMENT='...' in CREATE statements. I have corrected this with a patch (attached and sent to the H2 maintainers):
https://code.google.com/p/h2database/issues/detail?id=474

4) H2 does not appear to support the index/FK syntax generated by hibernate for the MySQL5 dialects. For example:

It would be nice if you can create a patch to fix this. I believe it would be relatively straight-forward once you get familiar with how H2 handles ""alter table"".

The feature would also allow instructors to use the workflow and confidentiality of Assignments to mark the submissions.

Currently, students could obviously copy and paste a URL into the current Textarea. But, a formal URL submission would be a submission type instead of inline or an attachment (or perhaps a mix) but could add the feature of being more canonical.

There is also the opportunity to validate that the link is formated properly and returns an HTTP 200.

The URL could also be fetched to get class information like:
* TITLE tag
* HTTP modification data

It would also be great if it could also fetch Open Graph Protocol ( http://opengraphprotocol.org )information.  It's basically some RDFa-formatted metatags in the HEAD outlined here

The four ""required"" and relevant properties are:
og:title
og:type 
og:image 
og:url

Others properties might also be relevant to assignment submission:
og:description 
og:site_name

Open Graph could be supported at the Java level, or do something like populate the Textarea with JavaScript with something like https://github.com/fiann/jquery.ogp

        <ul>
          <li>Download multiple files and folders to your computer from a Sakai site's <em>Resources</em> or <em>Drop Box</em>,</li>
          <li>Upload multiple files and folders to your <em>Resources</em> or <em>Drop Box</em> folder,</li>
          <li>Upload  files that are bigger than <strong>250 MB</strong> to your Sakai site.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> A  WebDAV connection must be set up separately to each site's <em>Resources</em> and <em>Drop Box</em> tool, on each computer you are using.  </p>

I think if a student just hit Save then they could regrade, if they press Submit then the review is final.

Are you asking for there to effectively not be a Submit button - all reviews are modifiable up to the point where the peer review period closes?

I'm not sure about this. If there's an opportunity for a student to save a draft of their comments for editing later, then isnt that sufficient? If not then perhaps we just remove the Submit button - that way all comments / grades are changeable.

If we're going to keep both buttons then the save button could be renamed as ""Save As Draft"" and the submit button at ""Publish"" - this would be more in line with other tools (I think).

We have had some of those instances, and in those cases a separate ""save as draft"" and ""submit/publish"" option would not necessarily solve the problem. 
 
In many cases, the reviewer believed they had everything correct. They would have hit the submit button. Then, 5 seconds later, they realize they uploaded the wrong file - especially in cases where they had to review two or more peers. I believe there needs to be a way for the reviewer to change the reviews up to the peer review due date or the instructor to clear out a review and allow a re-submission from the reviewer.

The interface would also be cleaner with less checkboxes and less complexity. 

This isn't something I'm working on at the moment, just seems like it would be something nice to have for a future version. The attachments would still need separate folders  but I don't think anything else would.

Free alternatives such as Libre Office, Microsoft Office Starter and iWork all available make this make more sense than editing csv files nowadays.

Additionally, the zip file upload process is super sensitive, for instance the following things have caused problems.
- If the folder with the csv is nested to deep (for example if you uncompress to a folder called bulk_download and recompress at that level)
- If the folder with the csv is nested to shallow (for example if you just compress right at the same level as the csv file without the folder it's in, it fails with an unusual error
- If you have a file in the zip package that it isn't expecting, for instance the editor I use makes .bak files without cleaning them up and this make it so the csv file wouldn't re-import",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SAK-21399,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,,,,"0|108f80:",9223372036854775807,,,,,Not started,,,,,,,"28-Sep-2017 04:37;farreri;Hi [~jonespm], should we still take a look at this issue?

Faculty members are used to a 'wizard' of sorts to take them through the set-up process. I have found several folks who used the Gradebook all semester and never actually set up their grade book other than creating assignments (items). They'll come in at the end of the semester claiming that their students are complaining about receiving a grade that didn't match up to the grade scale the syllabus showed. When we look at the grade scale in Oncourse we find that the faculty member didn't realize this area existed and the scale was not changed from the default. Is there a way to have a wizard for the setup process? This seems to be a biggie from my perspective because as I was looking at the Gradebook I tried changing from points to percentages (as though I were a faculty member who didn't realize this needed to be set up) and it changed my points to a percentage which completely messed up the grades I had previously entered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14545,,,,,,"0|103lso:",21030,,,,,Not started,,,,,,,"21-Oct-2008 02:03;jean-francois.leveque@upmc.fr;New feature",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It would be nice if a user can create a testing/grading schema from the gradebook-up. This means, first create the grading items and then link this items to the corresponding tests/assignments.

From the implementation point, I think is not quite safe to have a tool such as Assignments to be able to hold an internal reference to a gradebook item which is not externally maintained at all. This gives room for potentially overlapping tools onto the same gradebook items. For example, assume an empty (non linked) gradebook item exists. Now, create a new assignment and choose this to be linked to this GB item.

(Or maybe I'm reading more into it)

As far as history, Samigo was created at Stanford, Assignment at Michigan and Gradebook at IU. Assignment and Samigo were created before Gradebook so they had the capability of doing internal grading. When Gradebook came about in, they created features for pushing their internal grade to gradebook as well as attaching to an existing Gradebook item. 

As you said multiple tools could potentially link to the same gradebook item, causing confusion. Like Forums and Assignment can link to the same created gradebook item. I think that the ideal situation is that gradebook is the sole source of grades, but only one external source could claim that grade record at a time. None of the tools would keep internal grade records.

Assignment 2 had a popup UI for being able to create grade new grade entries from the external tool but no other tools used that. I don't think the workflow should have to be. Go to gradebook, create an item, go to tool, link to the item. The tool should be able to create that gradebook entry directly and claim it, or be able to link to one that isn't claimed. 

I'm not sure how close that gets to this, if this is what you were trying to do or even if this is the best idea, but I can say that this has been a been something coming up for awhile.","24-Mar-2015 18:03;fgeraci;Hello Matthew.

What you are describing is exactly what this changes. Without modifying (removing previous behavior) the internal implementation, assignments will now set the associated-with GB item as externally maintained hence no other tool or instance of a tool can point to it. Note that this is not true for Forums even after this patch because each tools has to be adjusted and I haven't touched it yet.

On the other hand, Samigo will no longer reject publishing an exam if a gradebook item exists with the same name of the test but will offer the user the possibility of linking this instance to said item.

This was proposed by faculty to 'reverse' designing a course grading schema (build exams from grades) but also addresses the overlaping issue.

Again, I am not presenting this as an issue because I wasn't sure what was the original design idea behind it, but merely as a feature request.

Thanks!
","26-Apr-2016 07:43;rainribbon;I strongly recommend against allowing association to existing gradebook items from samigo.

Numerous issues have arisen from associating in _Assignments_, so it's best to just send the grades to gradebook from the tool.  Examples of related issues in _Assignments_: SAK-29103,  SAK-29095, SAK-29780, SAK-29205, SAK-25944, SAK-31049.","26-Apr-2016 08:45;jonespm;Yeah, but there's also issues with having the grades linked from the tool. I think the ideal way is that the grade is maintained by the gradebook and tool links to it (like this describes) with the other option removed. However the tool should be able to add the gradebook item, in a workflow/UI that exists but isn't widely used. I think this could be used more often and maybe a 12 roadmap item.","26-Apr-2016 09:02;fgeraci;Hello,

We have been using Samigo 11 on production systems at Rutgers for an entire semester with no major complications after some patching and maintenance. One of the in-house changes was allowing Samigo to be linked to existing GB items with the same name of an assessment instance, either new one, or modified. 
Some people find this really useful since they create their assessments based on their GB schema. For example, if there is a GB item called ""Test 1"" and the instructor creates a ""Test 1"" exam, a new option will show up under Settings > Grading which reads ""Associate the existing GB item <blah> with this test"" ... should that option is selected, Samigo will proceed to ""link"" (remove the existing one, add a new one with same name and finally, record any submissions (if any) to that GB item) the GB item to the exam and mark it 'externally maintained' such that no two sources (other test, assignments, forum or anything) can record grades to it.

So far it has been working well, no complications or concerns. This is not mandatory, but a choice of settings from the maintainer should they opted to create exams based on their GB schema.

[~rainribbon] I understand from the tickets you listed above that the actual problem was actually a many-to-one association of Assignments to GB items. Marking a GB item as 'externally maintained' by another tool, actually disallows these M-to-O relationships for each GB item is solely maintained by that instance.

Thanks!

bts. I will need to revise the patches which are old and eventually put it as a pull-request, of course.","26-Apr-2016 09:06;rainribbon;Yeah, I'm not quite sure how the handling works, but maybe there's a better way to associate gradebook items to all other tools (e.g. assignments, forums, samigo) than currently exists?

There is a problem with not being able to null a grade in samigo once an adjustment has been made or grade entered, so if different grade handling would resolve the issue, that would be good.

[~fgeraci] That sounds like it works really well, to allow it to link to an existing item by replacing the association with the assessment's/assignment's data.  Is this handling the same in _Assignments_ in your instance?","26-Apr-2016 09:46;fgeraci;[~rainribbon] Assignment 10.x also externally maintain items such that no two Assignments and/or Tests can be sending grades to the same item. One thing I want to clarify is that for GB Item to be linked to a Tests, there mustn't exist a previous association to it. Once the item is associated as externally maintained by an item, it cannot be switched to another Assignment/Tests.

This suggestion only works if a GB item hasn't been associated to any item before.

A user case, again, would be: 

1. The instructor first created their GB schema
2. The instructor then creates all assessments/assignments and associate them accordingly.","26-Apr-2016 10:01;rainribbon;It's much better if you can't send two assignments or tests to the same gradebook item (because associating multiple assignments to the same gradebook item creates problems).  However, as far as I know, in both 10.x and 11 you _can_ associate multiple assignments (and, in fact, both a forum and an assignment) to the same gradebook item, per SAK-22673 and SAK-30594.

We found in our 10.2 instance that if you associate two assignments to the same item, the grading does not always work as intended.  Therefore, we made it so if a gradebook item is already associated to an existing assignment, you can't choose that same gradebook item from the list of options when associating a different assignment to the gradebook.","12-May-2016 12:17;fgeraci;[~rainribbon] Hello! Sorry, end of the semester, crazy times...

YES! Assignments DO NOT externally link GB items to them, we also took care of this. So basically, Test and Quizzes AND Assignments will externally link GB-item such that no two ""things"" (either Assignments or Assessments) can add to the same element.

The original patch, which needs to be reviewed, since this issue is OLD, is only for Test and Quizzes, although I will do a git pull request for 11.x with Samigo and Assignments, since they are related.

Dear Help@Vula,

Our 2nd and 3rd year courses are modularized. Students usually take more than one module each semester and  frequently have some flexibility in their choice of modules. They have to attend a tutorial session each week for each module. Currently, Vula doesn't allow signup for multiple tutorial sections, so we've been using the workaround of setting up ""pracs"" and ""labs"" and ""other""s that are actually tutorials. It would be easier, though, if it were possible for the site owner to rename the category (e.g., rename ""Practical Sections"" to ""2RA Tutorial Sections"", ""Lab Sections"" to ""2DE Tutorial Sections"", etc).  Is this something that could be done for 2018?""

Assignments: Revise Assignment(s) Permission available to Students,SAK-32700,71535,New Feature,OPEN,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project.

The scope of the permissions change are all assignments. Non-instructor roles are available on this screen to give edit permissions (students, guests, demo-students, etc).
 # We believe there could be a use case for setting a particular Assignment to be revisable by the student role. However, if there are such use cases, the scope of the permissions change for the student role should not be ALL existing assignments, but be confined to editing an existing assignment.

 

RESULTANT FLAWS OF CURRENT WORKFLOW
 * 2. IF a Student has been given the “Revise Assignments” permission, they then see the “Edit” link below the assignment title (they normally click on the title in order to “submit” an assignment) on any Assignments created after the permissions were given. Edit permissions include the little used features at the bottom of the screen which include “Private Note.” 

 
 * {color:#351c75}3. Another feature at the bottom of the Assignment Create/Edit screen allows one to create an “All Purpose Item” - this item _could_ be created/revised by students and be made visible to other /subsequent students by checking a box. If the Assignment permissions were set for the Student role to included “Revise Assignment(s)” the students could also add an All Purpose Item or edit an existing one. We just encountered a use case for this.{color}
  
  
 Because Private Note permissions are for sharing to yourself(Instructors only) and/or others in the Instructors role, we consider this a bug. 
  
 In addition to visibility being an issue, a second bug causes the feature to be non-functional because the first student who adds a Private Note, will never see their note and will cause future students/instructors who edit the Assignment to get an error upon save telling them “Alert: Please enter the Private Note text.”, thus creating an infinite edit loop. (The Instructor is able to delete that note and end the condition that caused it).
  
 Expected behavior is that non-Instructor roles never see the Private Note option (which then avoids the loop).
  
 {color:#351c75}SUGGESTED CHANGES/FIXES:{color}

{color:#351c75}1.{color}
 * {color:#351c75}a. Add Permissions to single Assignments (instead of ALL assignments). Behavior afterwards: Assignment tool Permissions are inherited by all Assignments, unless or until a single Assignment’s permission are changed.    {color}

 * {color:#351c75}b. Remove non-Instructor roles from being editable via the Permissions screen. Create a saki-property which would allow them to be edited.{color}

{color:#351c75}2.      Remove “Private Note” from student role screens.{color}

{color:#351c75}3.      Re-order All Purpose Note to be the first one the Instructor sees. Add group awareness to current ability to specify names (via checkboxes) or Instructor/Student roles (via checkboxes). Provide full RTE. Provide help text, instructions as too why an Assignment might include an “All Purpose Note”. This one change would allow some measure of providing different sets of instructions to different groups in a simple way that could be built upon later like the Tests & Quizzes “exceptions” feature.{color}

The ultimate goal could be to remove ""Home"" from the top ""navigation bar"" and migrate that button's functionality into what I'm calling ""top right personal drop down menu"" (TRPDDM). The idea is, I think, to remove the concept of there being a ""Home Site"" and to emulate what Twitter / ebay / amazon does: there's useful info in the TRPDDM, you click on it and you get to access the functionality - why do you have to know there's a site called Home?

Examples

!twit.png|thumbnail!   !ebay.png|thumbnail!   !amazon.png|thumbnail!

The plan is that we add some ""high profile"" ""My Home"" links in the TRPDDM, eg, profile, preferences, calendar, maybe one or two others. We probably wouldnt want all My Home functionality although what is and isnt shown could be configurable.

The consensus seemed to be that we may, initially at least, need a 3 way property 

 1 - just show my Home in navigation bar

 2 - show my Home in navigation bar and in ""top right personal drop down menu""

 3 - just show ""top right personal drop down menu""

If 2 or 3 is selected then the links to show should be ready from a property. A sensible default should be given.

We may ultimately have 3 as the default (or even only) option.

We would like to display availability information of Electronic Items by querying an OpenURL resolver (SFX) for, for example, items located in PubMed. Initially we thought that both library and electronic items would come from the same source, it has become clear hat this is not the case.

To do this we need to write a second Middleware component (EIAS) (cf LIAS: SAK-20676). We need two separate middleware services as we don't want to bundle two requests into one call. The reason for this is that (at Oxford) the SFX API may have performance issues and so to make sure that we don't block the getting of responses by a slow SFX we make them separately. We may hit the browser connection limit:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/561046/how-many-concurrent-ajax-xmlhttprequest-requests-are-allowed-in-popular-browser

so may need to submit batch requests. We need to investigate this as ideally we would like to have smooth steady page updates. The call to EIAS will have to pass the whole OpenURL.

Additional extensions to the Juice JavaScript library has been written which talks to the EIAS alongside the one that talks to the LIAS.

We must also make sure that we handle both LIAS and EIAS availability information consistently in terms of the user interface.

we need to display availability information for items in a reading list. The reading list will be rendered as normal by Sakai but then once the page is ready in the web browser some JavaScript (Juice) will run which will scan the page for embedded metadata (COinS) and use this information to make additional requests to retrieve availability information.

Due to security restrictions (see below) it is not possible for the JavaScript to contact an availability service directly, the requests from the browser will be sent to LIAS which will the retrieve availability information. 

An explanation of why this is needed: for security reasons browser requests are limited to only talking to the server from which the page originates or a to service on another host that must return data in a specific format to get around this restriction (JSONP). The source of availability information doesn't currently support JSONP and is hosted on a different server to Sakai. 

The document returned when asking for availability information is very large, this makes it slow to transfer and then slow to parse by a JavaScript client.
   
The document returned is complex and we would need to embed complex parsing code into the client, this limits the ability to reuse the client side code.

If the availability source or format changes in the future the clients can be isolated from this change by updating LIAS

Reading list requests to LIAS:

The JavaScript in the reading list page will make asynchronous requests to LIAS using the Document Availability Information API (DAIA), currently (May 2011) version 0.5. DAIA allows for two encodings, JSON or XML, to ease parsing on the client side we should initially develop with JSON, but XML should be considered as a future extension.

Retrieval of Availability by LIAS from availability service (using Ex Libris Primo as an example)

The availability information for items in the can be obtained by making requests via web services.

Example of 

http://XXX/PrimoWebServices/xservice/getit?institution=OXVU1&docId=UkOxUUkOxUb10108045&isLoggedIn=false&onCampus=false
The response has been trimmed to only show the relevant part (some URLs have been removed to protect the innocent)

  <sear:LIBRARY>
   <sear:institution>OX</sear:institution>
   <sear:library>BLL</sear:library>
   <sear:status>check_holdings</sear:status>
   <sear:collection>Main Libr</sear:collection>

   <sear:url>http://XXX/XXX.pl?id=10108045</sear:url>
  </sear:LIBRARY>

General Notes

LIAS should map the results retrieved from Primo onto DAIA and return them to the client. Although the service will deployed initially with Sakai it does not bind against any Sakai APIs so that it can be reused in other environments.

My major concern thus far is that there aren't permission checks in many of these new methods.  It looks like the only SecurityException that is thrown is if the user does not exist.  I also question the ""catch Exception"" that turns around and throws a SecurityException (for example, ForumTopicEntityProviderImpl.createEntity line 228, ForumMessageEntityProviderImpl.createEntity 249).

Thanks for the sakai configuration... that was the issue.  I tested the first curl statement and I found that I was able to add topics to a forum with any valid authentication, even if the user isn't a member of the site.  For example, I tested with a user named ""test9"" who isn't a member of the site and I was able to add a topic with:

curl -d ""forumId=1&messagesCount=0&topicDescription=&topicId=&topicShortDescription=&topicTitle=The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog&typeUuid=&unreadMessagesCount=0"" -u ""test9:test9"" http://localhost:8080/direct/forum_topic/new?__auth=basic 


Please test every curl command and ensure that only user's with the appropriate permissions are able to run these commands.  Try to think of all the odd cases you can make up and send me the list of use cases you tested with.  Let me know when the patch is ready and I can test again.

For the next step before I can commit this into trunk, could you write up a spec on how to use each method and what the parameters are?

010_SAK-2591_textareaLinkOptions.patch - These are patches to the textarea project
that allow it to send links from forums, assignments, and quizzes
to FCK's resource browser.
 
010_SAK-2615_forumsTopicEntityProvider.patch - This is the entity provider in msgcntr

code not needed for this purpose was deleted.  These deletions may not
be in accordance with everyone's needs.

010_SAK-2627_filemanager.patch - we heavily modified the javascript implementing
the filemanager in 2.7.1, and this patch drops in that modified
code to 2.8

030_SAK-2618_forumsMessagesAndTopicsEntytpProvider.patch - This is an entity
provider that is used by our modified textarea to get information
on forums, topic, and threads

010_SAK-2623_iSylLinkMigrationSam.patch - Entity Provider necessary to provide access from
the T&Q links embedded in other tools. Modifications were also made to 
support migration of links contained in Assessments.

030_SAK-2620_isyllabusAssignments.patch - Entity provider relied upon to
provide information on a site's assignments.

030_SAK-2668_syllabusLinkMigration.patch - Migration of links within a 
syllabus

030_SAK-2671_calendarLinkMigration.patch - Migration of links within 
a calendar entry

040_SAK-2670_assignLinkMigration.patch - migration of links within
as assignment

040_SAK-2672_forumsLinkMigration.patch -migration of links within

040_SAK-2698_LBLinkMigration.patch - lessonbuilder - migration of links within 
a LessonBuilder lesson text entity

100_SAK-2663_resourceLinkMigration.patch - migration of links contained
within an HTML resource.


A few additional notes:  Upon migration, samigo links are de-activated
since it is necessary to publish them, and this actually changes the
link.  In the case of forums and assignments, these links are surrounded
by brackets but not de-activated.  This is to indicate that an assignment 
or a forum entity need to be published (ie edited and saved) to make them
accessible.  JForums links are similarly de-activated because they cannot
be migrated properly.

17) Under quizzes in the duplicated site, take the quiz from the source site and publish it.
18) Go to each of the rich-text objects you created (and just migrated).  Notice there should be brackets around assignments, forum topics, and quizzes. In the case of assignments and forum topics, you can remove the brackets.  In the case of quizzes, you will have to remove the brackets and re-establish the link using the file manager. Having done this in Assignments, Forums, Quizzes, HTML-Resources, Schedule Event Descriptions, Lessons, and Syllabus entries, all your links should be ready for use.
19) Add a student to the duplicated site that is not in the source site.
20) Log in as the student you added in step 19) above.
21) Verify that all of the links in the Duplicated Site work as they should.
22) Log back in as your instructor self
23) Set up a new site containing all of the following tools: Assignments, Forums, Quizzes, Schedule, Resources, Lessons, Syllabus
24) Go to that site’s site info and select the option to Import from Site
25) Pick the option to ‘replace my data’
26) Select the site created in step 1) above
27) Verify the warning message appears
28) Click on the checkboxes for Assignments, T&Q, Syllabus, Schedule, Forums, Resources, and Lessons
29) In the imported site,  edit Assignments and Forum topics in the same was as in steps 15) and 16 above to bring them out of draft mode.
30) Repeat step 17) for quizzes
31) Add a student ot the site into which these imports have been taking place who is not included in the source site set up in step 1)
32) Log in as that student and verify all links are working properly.",,,Not started,,,,,,,"07-Dec-2015 10:59;ncaidin;Per triage team, since it is a contributed patch(es), making the priority a little lower, to Major.

I don't know of another case in Sakai where something that can be on or off when set one way or the other causes a problem.

So maybe an additional control, in addition to the on/off property, which if on is checked and if there are more than x (maybe 300 as the default?) users it doesn't attempt to get/build the list would help.

Also, does it pick up provided users as well as the local Sakai users, or just local? That might also be an issue as to whether it is appropriate to add to the base level code.

","27-Feb-2009 08:14;steve.swinsburg;Hi John,

Good points, I'll add in another control for the number of users. Should this be a sakai.property as well or hardcoded into the logic (since someone could set that to 30000 and cause the same issues).

Re provided users, they aren't included becuase UserDirectoryService.getUsers() only gets internal users. Which is good and bad. 

Good because it won't mean thousands of users, bad because they aren't included.

What do you think. Is it worth me doing the number of user's filter? With these points above I'm not sure if it is appropriate for the base code, now I think about it more. No worries!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Prevent multiple site imports and log to database what was imported,SAK-25541,61250,New Feature,Awaiting Review,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project.

We found that SAK-23897 was lacking, just putting the import into a separate thread really doesn't solve the issue.

This patch does three major things.
1.  Prevent multiple imports at one time.  In the UI the  Finish button will be disabled when they start the import.  Beyond that, even if they refresh the tool and try to run another site import it will not allow another import if there is a current one running and the user will get a warning stating that there is an import currently running.

2.  Creates new tables that tracks the site import.  From these tables you can see how long the import ran, who ran the import, what the source site/s were, and what tools from those sites were imported.

The jira mentions 3 functions:

1) Prevent multiple imports at one time
2) Creates new tables that tracks the site import
3) Emails the user who started the import when the import is complete.


The jira https://jira.sakaiproject.org/browse/SAK-23897 already does all 3 of these things.  

For #1: it checks to make sure there are no other threads running before running a new site import.  Granted, by not using a DB, it won't be cluster aware so if 2 different instructors try to import on two different nodes at the same time, then you could have multiple running at the same time.  It was a decision I made since I didn't believe it merited a new DB table for this use case.

For #2:  The events are tracked in the event database and anyone with a little experience in mysql can create a report based on these events.

For #3:  The site import already emails the user when the import is complete.


Am I missing something else this patch does?","14-Jan-2014 13:33;jkusnetz;Here is what I replied on the sakai-dev list:

#1 is cluster aware since it’s logged in the database.  For us we have a lot of nodes in our cluster so this was important for us.  Plus we thought that spawning off a new thread was not need and could be difficult to track if the thread had errors.

#3, yes both patches do the same thing in regards to the email.  We actually borrowed your code for this one. 

#2 I think is the bigger one.   I haven’t looked at what trunk is doing, so my only experience is with 2.9.x.  There is a site.upd event and then the individual tools that were imported trigger their own event.  But there is still a lot lacking.  Was the site.upd event generated from an import there are other things that also triggers a site.upd event.  We actually created a new event with this too, site.import so there is no ambiguity.  But even if we could figure out that the site.upd was triggered from an import, we still don’t know what the source site/s were.  We don’t know when the import started and finished.  I guess we can infer who did the import by looking at the session user tied to that event.  For the tools, we have to rely on the tool’s own events, and some may be lacking.  Plus there is no way to tell if that tool’s even was generated from a site import or something else, similar to the site.upd event.  Plus if we are merging, the tools can be coming from multiple sites, there is no way to tell what the source site was for that event.

All of this is solved via the new tables.  Here are the tables and their schema and what they track.  Below is a description of what they do.

mysql> show create table SAKAI_SITE_IMPORT_STATE\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: SAKAI_SITE_IMPORT_STATE
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `SAKAI_SITE_IMPORT_STATE` (
  `SITE_IMPORT_STATE_ID` bigint(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `SITE_ID` varchar(99) NOT NULL,
  `STARTEDDATETIME` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  `SITE_IMPORT_STATES_LIST_ID` bigint(20) NOT NULL,
  `FINISHEDDATETIME` timestamp NULL DEFAULT NULL,
  `USER_ID` varchar(99) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`SITE_IMPORT_STATE_ID`),
  KEY `test_idx` (`SITE_IMPORT_STATES_LIST_ID`),
  CONSTRAINT `site_import_states_ID_FK` FOREIGN KEY (`SITE_IMPORT_STATES_LIST_ID`) REFERENCES `SAKAI_SITE_IMPORT_STATES_LIST` (`SITE_IMPORT_STATES_LIST_ID`) ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE NO ACTION
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=9 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

So this table tracks what site is being imported, when it started, and when it ended, who kicked off the import, and what the current state of the import is.


mysql> show create table SAKAI_SITE_IMPORT_STATES_LIST\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: SAKAI_SITE_IMPORT_STATES_LIST
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `SAKAI_SITE_IMPORT_STATES_LIST` (
  `SITE_IMPORT_STATES_LIST_ID` bigint(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `IMPORT_STATE` varchar(45) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`SITE_IMPORT_STATES_LIST_ID`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=4 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

This table just handles the definition of the import state.  Currently we just have 3 states, Finished, Running, Error.  So with this we can see if there were problems, or if a import is still running.  New states can be added as needed.

mysql> show create table SAKAI_SITE_IMPORT_TOOLS\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: SAKAI_SITE_IMPORT_TOOLS
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `SAKAI_SITE_IMPORT_TOOLS` (

  CONSTRAINT `site_import_tools_import_state_ID_FK` FOREIGN KEY (`SITE_IMPORT_STATE_ID`) REFERENCES `SAKAI_SITE_IMPORT_STATE` (`SITE_IMPORT_STATE_ID`) ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE NO ACTION
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=71 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> show create table SAKAI_SITE_IMPORT_STATES_LIST\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: SAKAI_SITE_IMPORT_STATES_LIST
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `SAKAI_SITE_IMPORT_STATES_LIST` (
  `SITE_IMPORT_STATES_LIST_ID` bigint(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `IMPORT_STATE` varchar(45) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`SITE_IMPORT_STATES_LIST_ID`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=4 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

These two tables show what tools came from what source sites and when they were imported.  Again for us, knowing the sources of the tools is very important and as far as I know there is no way to figure this out now.
                                                                                                                                                                                 
All of these are questions that I as a Sakai administrator have not been able to answer until now.  Again, if trunk’s event logging has more events or there is another way to pull out this information I’d like to know how.  But we created this patch and tables to solve that issue.

I’ve started to work on reports based off of this data, here is an example:

A while back I wrote an announcements entityprovider that Oxford are using and recently has had a bit more work done on it by them too, so we should review this one and the existing to see if the current one is missing anything in the one here.","18-Jun-2011 15:39;smarquard;I'm wondering why roster needs an EB when site membership is available through /direct/site/ - is it something to do with profiles and photos?
","20-Jun-2011 03:17;a.fish@lancaster.ac.uk;Isn't the announcement entityprovider already in 2.8? If not some elves have come in the night and coded one up on my dev machine, because I haven't ...

How about adding calendar events to this ticket? I'm working on it now so I can contribute a patch for that bit.","20-Jun-2011 03:54;steve.swinsburg;Yep the annc provider in 2.8 and onwards is the one I did. I'm also not sure about the roster since you can get the site list and then get profile images from the profile entityprovider.

From what I was told the bulk of these were written by some students, so should be code reviewed. ","20-Jun-2011 06:12;chmaurer@iupui.edu;I think they started with the Announcement provider that was in 2.8 and added some more stuff, but I'm not 100% sure on that.
As for roster, I think there was the intention of displaying the profile picture, but they hadn't gotten all of the issues with binary content resolved.
And yes, this work was mostly done by grad students, so I'd highly recommend a code review!","20-Jun-2011 11:08;natjohns;I will confirm that all the code, besides the new servlet in entitybroker, was written by students. This is the reason for roster being done separately. They didn't know what was already there. I would recommend if there are better ways to do things, that this be refactored. 

As for the new servlet, I added that. It's called oauthdirect and it just layers OAuth on top of the direct servlet - I didn't want to lock down direct in fear it might break the system elsewhere. I'm sure it could use some work too... might be able to leverage the current direct servlet better. It adds the codehaus OAuth library to the direct servlet. I really wanted to use OAuth for Spring Security, but that requires Spring 3. The codehaus version uses Spring 2.5.x and fits the 2.7.1 version of Sakai that the students worked on. It became what is now OAuth for Spring Security and hasn't changed a lot since becoming a spring project other than getting libraries up to date (could be more by now). 

Furthermore, the reason I didn't go with the oauth.net solution that Oxford used is because 1) Chris and I just couldn't get it to talk to my mobile code which is using OAuth for Spring Security and 2) it didn't seem to follow the spec when it came to things like proper signature algorithms.

","22-Jun-2011 06:35;mizematr;I recently wrote an EB provider for private messages in msgcntr 2.7.3 which allowed us to add a ""Reply Privately"" function to the forums tool so Instructors can reply directly to a student and have the response stored in the Messages tool.  If anyone's interested, I'd be glad to share it here.","27-Jun-2011 05:45;a.fish@lancaster.ac.uk;I've just tried the resource provider out and getEntities only gets resources for the mercury site. Shouldn't it aggregate resources in a synoptic view mode if no site id is supplied?","27-Jun-2011 05:53;chmaurer@iupui.edu;The students were doing most of their testing in the mercury site, despite my urging them not to!  So, it's quite likely the resource provider isn't fully fleshed out yet.","27-Jun-2011 06:31;a.fish@lancaster.ac.uk;It does need a bit of fleshing out. Have you got a functional spec that you are working to?

I'm working on it a bit on my dev machine.  I've added a siteId parameter and if not specified I return all the resources that the user can access, a la synoptic view. I'll post a patch when I have something useful. Not trying to take over or anything.","27-Jun-2011 07:21;natjohns;There are no real functional requirements. We asked the students to list the resources for a site and allow them to be downloaded to a viewer on a device. 

Please do submit patches back. My goal is for the community to take these entity providers and keep on making them better.","27-Jun-2011 07:52;a.fish@lancaster.ac.uk;I've attached a modded version of the resource provider. I worked on it in my sakai source so couldn't patch, if you know what I mean. I've added the site name and the access url to the returned XML. I'm not too convinced about the usefulness of returning the binary resource though. Can't a user just click on the link on their phone browser?","27-Jun-2011 08:34;a.fish@lancaster.ac.uk;Added contentType to the returned XML.","27-Jun-2011 16:36;steve.swinsburg;I think Adrian is right, we don't need the actual binary returned, just the link for people to click. Or will that play havoc with auth?","28-Jun-2011 04:32;natjohns;The reason we were going after binary to begin with is because we were still focused on native mobile applications at the time. Since then we have shifted focus to JQuery Mobile webapps so a link may be ok. As for the auth, I'm not sure... I don't have a solid understanding of where resources are coming from in Sakai to answer that question.","28-Jun-2011 07:51;a.fish@lancaster.ac.uk;It may as well be left in for now. Is this intended for inclusion in 2.9? If so, a little scope reduction may be in order. Maybe resource listing and retrieval should be the functionality to focus on for 2.9, just for the sake of getting something solid and useful in. I'm happy to keep working on the resource broker if that's okay.","29-Jun-2011 07:54;a.fish@lancaster.ac.uk;Did some tidying up. Removed unused injections, added user's workspace files and rejigged the produced XML.","29-Jun-2011 07:56;a.fish@lancaster.ac.uk;Find attached a simple perl script for calling the resources target.","29-Jun-2011 07:58;a.fish@lancaster.ac.uk;I've attached a sample of the data returned by the resources provider.","30-Jun-2011 09:16;buckett;Nathaniel: Could you elaborate on what signature problems you had with the net.oauth code?","30-Jun-2011 10:22;natjohns;Sure. The oauth code that I was looking at was in uk.ac.ox.oucs.vle.OAuthProviderImpl in generateAccessToken(...) and generateRequestToken(...)

        // for now use md5 of name + current time as token
        String token_data = consumer_key + System.nanoTime();
        String token = DigestUtils.md5Hex(token_data);

and...

        // TODO Need a better way of generating tokens in the long run.
        // for now use md5 of name + current time as token
        String token_data = consumer_key + System.nanoTime();
        String token = DigestUtils.md5Hex(token_data);
        // for now use md5 of name + current time + token as secret
        String secret_data = consumer_key + System.nanoTime() + token;
        String secret = DigestUtils.md5Hex(secret_data);

Here is the spec where I am referring:
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4

md5 is not a valid signature method (that's how the spec refers to it). And so when I tried to use OAuth for Spring Security as the client, it just wouldn't communicate. You could probably use the oauth.net client, but I think you'd run into the same issue when another client that is conforming to the spec came along to try to talk to entity providers.

I'm far from a security expert, so if I am just being naive about this, I'm happy to be corrected.","30-Jun-2011 10:36;natjohns;To answer Adrian's question about target version: I don't know if 2.9 is where it needs to go. I am working with the Oncourse team at IU to get it in for this coming Fall semester and I believe we are on version 2.7.x still. My hope is that the community picks up all of the entity providers and makes them better and that they find their way into the truck at some point.","30-Jun-2011 11:07;natjohns;BTW: It turns out that my guy did assignment and semi-integrated it with gradebook. I don't think that IU uses these tools, but they may be of use to others. All code is checked in on this same branch.

","11-Jul-2011 16:00;steve.swinsburg;Nate, any chance the OAuth mods to the direct servlet could be bundled up into a patch that we can review and apply? We've hit a stumbling block with the CLE Mobile app so I'd like to look into this as soon as possible. Also ,do you have any docs on it? 

Thanks, Steve","11-Jul-2011 16:07;natjohns;I don't have any of the branches around or the computer I use for sakai work right now. But all I did was make a copy of the direct servlet module and add oauth to it. I didn't actually change the direct servlet because I didn't want to interfere with any pre-existing functionality. If you'd like to review, look at the oauthdirect directory here:

https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn//msub/iu.edu/student-mobility/sakai-2.7.1/entitybroker/","11-Jul-2011 16:24;steve.swinsburg;I compared EB 1.3.17/tool to your oauthdirect module and got the attached patch. Does that look complete?","11-Jul-2011 16:27;natjohns;Yes, that looks correct.","11-Jul-2011 16:28;natjohns;Also note, that this is using codehaus for oauth spring security because I didn't want to mess up anything when it came to spring 2.5.x... if you are going to work in a spring 3 environment, I would remove the codehaus stuff and go straight for the spring 3 flavor of oauth for spring security. ","12-Jul-2011 01:30;adamm;My 2 cents; At this stage would it be sensible for ""the community"" (ie, a couple of people) to do a comparison with Oxford's oAuth implementation and Indiana's? 

As I understand it the Florida initiative is planning to use Oxford's oAuth but here you're planning to use Indiana's. We shouldn't really be diverging at such an early stage in the proceedings.","12-Jul-2011 02:00;steve.swinsburg;I think they could be complementary. The way I understand it is that IU seem to have a working oauthdirect servlet which could be run alongside the standard direct servlet and allow providers to require oauth requests. The Oxford impl is about allowing a user to login via OAuth and a tool to manage that access?

Would you be able to patch something up and send it? I'd be happy to apply it to my local trunk and give it a whirl.
","12-Jul-2011 02:07;buckett;Nathaniel, thanks for the feedback, but I don't use MD5 for the signature, just for the token generation, the current code isn't ideal but it should work as the token should just be treated as that and no decoding of it should be needed.","12-Jul-2011 02:11;a.fish@lancaster.ac.uk;Just as a bit of an aside, is there any particular reason why this all couldn't be done in the pda portal?","12-Jul-2011 04:03;natjohns;I'm not a sakai developer so take all of this with a grain of salt. The project that I am working on is very heavy spring based and was already using OAuth for Spring Security for other connections, so that is what was going to be used as the client side for OAuth. I tried for quite some time to get it to connect with an oauth.net provider and just kept running into road blocks. Could it work, probably with more time, but I just ran out. That is why I just created a simple oauthdirect servlet and tried to minimize impact to other tools. Oxford's tools could run side by side if desired since they run through the original direct servlet. The other thing is that the Oxford OAuth tool provides token management for the user, and at IU we did not do anything for this because of time constraints.

 When creating a new assignment with TII feature , the default is 'None' for the repository in which to submit/store the student's paper. Remove any default so that the assignment creator is forced to make a conscious selection. Pop up a reminder box if they have not done so.
 
 Test Plan
 
 1. Add new Assignment.
2. Select Turnitin option.
3. Check that there is no pre-selected default for 'Submit papers to the following repository'.
4. Try to proceed without making a selection.
5. Check that pop-up reminder appears to force you to make a selection at this point.
6. Make a selection and proceed with the rest of the assignment creation.

This is configured by turnitin.repository.setting.value. I've made my fix so that this server config will override the fix. As such we should make sure it is not set.

After a detailed investigation, polls and profile2 define single template per file, while site-management and reset-pass define multiple templates per file. And the function processEmailTemplates cannot handle multiple templates in one file.

This patch give the function ability to handle multiple files in one file. It will first try to guess it's a multiple-template file, and then try the single one.

Changes:
1. To multiple-template, the root element is <emailTemplates> and for each template, <emailTemplate> is used. To single-template, the root element is <emailTemplate>

2. To multiple-template, <key> can be defined under <emailTemplates> and if another <key> is defined in <emailTemplate> the template-specified key will override the root one.

3. A new model EmailTemplates is added to handle the multiple-template file.

4. If 'owner' is not defined in template, 'admin' is used by default.

Earle pointed me some code that RSmart/Scriba used to use for Flyway. The concept there seemed simple.

https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/msub/rsmart.com/sakai/trunk/rsmart/upgrade/

The main code DbUpgrader is pretty simple and doesn't take into some of the cases we'd hit in the community (mentioned below like contrib tools) skipping scripts for newer installs) but could be a start

https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/msub/rsmart.com/sakai/trunk/rsmart/upgrade/upgrade-impl/src/java/com/rsmart/cle/upgrade/DbUpgrader.java

I just didn't know if it would be the best idea to.

#1 Run auto.ddl to just provide a ""base schema"" dump as a SQL file as V1 from some revision of Sakai (like Sakai 11) and build the future conversions from there. Dump the schema to this file and never run auto.ddl again on core.

#2 Leave auto.ddl as a requirement BUT keep the flyway scripts updated so that they will update to whatever version you start from. 

#3 Some hybrid solution if auto.ddl can be managed. I think the ideal is that if there is no schema, run the full auto.ddl otherwise run the scripts.

I mean I think it's fine if we started up with flyway on Sakai 12 (no scripts) and everyone was updating. But if there was some school out (or nightly) that started on Sakai 12, they obviously wouldn't run any of the conversion scripts, the database would need to reflect that they're all ""caught up"". I don't think it took this into account?

I feel like we'd have to go with option #2 (Leave auto.ddl on) because contrib tools coming in will need their schema created still and I don't know how #3 would work with that. They may or may not be able to participate in this process. Though not all schools have auto.ddl on in production either.  I think it would be *nice* if we had some interface that contrib tools could implement to register their conversion scripts with the ""upgrade handler"" but this would be a wishlist idea.

I don't know though, I've certainly thought about it, and there is a proof of concept but seems like more was necessary to finish it off.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

#* All the other tabs are for different views. A tab, which when clicked, would cause a download does not fit in with the rest of the tool.
# The roster members are now split up into role tables.
#* This change was done as it is a waste of screen real estate to repeat the same information over and over. That is list out ""access"" for each user who is an access role.
#* The filtering via role and group still works, as well as search 
# The member details are now in line with the role header
# Roles are organized in the page by number of permissions, that is the role with the most permissions (via the permissions tab) is listed first, etc
# Since not all of the roster data may be retrieved in the first page load, the number of members shown is listed
#  If a role table is larger than the screen the header stays fixed to the top as you scroll down
# The number of members shown is also fixed
# Stripping was fixed in the roster tool
# The row you are hovering over is now indicated
# Add the ability to show a 12 hour clock in the roster via the sakai.property {{roster.12HrClock}}. The roster time and date is now controlled by the bundle: {{lastVisitTimeDate}}

I have tested it in a 10.x but I'm sure that the issue happens in trunk too.

The steps to reproduce the issue are:

1) Create a new Pool and a question in it.
2) In the CKEditor, in Source edition, put some HTML not allowed by AntiSamy filters by default, i.e:

<img src=""http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{\mathrm{d}&space;35x}{\mathrm{d}&space;x%2A2}"" title=""\frac{\mathrm{d} 35x}{\mathrm{d}x%2A2}"" />

3) Save the question. The questions is saved and no warning is shown to users. So users think it is working fine.
4) Edit the question again. The popup shows the warning (not very explanatory) and the bad HTML is deleted. Cancelling the edition does not preserve it, so the users have lost a part of their work without any chance of recovering it.

IMHO the warning should be shown when user saves the work in step 3, not letting users to save the work until the conflicting HTML has been removed or changed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SAK-25359,SAK-39477,SAK-31991,,,,,,,"04-Jun-2015 05:20;daniel.merino;SAM-2578-1.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/42843/SAM-2578-1.png","04-Jun-2015 05:20;daniel.merino;SAM-2578-2.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/42844/SAM-2578-2.png","04-Jun-2015 05:20;daniel.merino;SAM-2578-3.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/42845/SAM-2578-3.png",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,SAM-2578,,,"0|108m3s:",9223372036854775807,,,,,Not started,,,,,,,"16-Jun-2015 15:20;ern;The issue not working in 11 is related to SAK-29531 which is a regression in morpheus portal.","20-Jun-2015 20:21;ern;This issue is a feature request as the warning appearing before and serving as a confirmation to submitting the text is a design change.

Maintain submission history for assignments that includes submission contents,SAK-29893,66015,New Feature,Awaiting Review,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project.

These updates overwrite the student's previous submission, so all previous submission content is gone and unrecoverable. We would like to retain the full submission content for all submissions rather than overwriting the previous one.

It would be nice to give students and instructors the ability to refer to the full content of previous submissions. This would also solve the problem that occurs when saving a draft after submitting, as the draft replaces the submission, resulting in the instructor not being able to view the original submission if the student does not submit the draft. This has lead to support calls along the lines of “Student claims they submitted; instructor cannot view submission”.

Given that we would need to store a separate row for each submission / draft, there are some challenges to overcome. For example, rather than getting the single submission object for the instructor's view, we would need to pull the most recent non-draft submission. Other concerns include:
* performance concerns with storing everything in the XML column
* maintaining compatibility with legacy data vs converting legacy data

Performance:
From a performance perspective, we wouldn't want to grab all submissions for an assignment and then filter out the drafts in application code. It would be more efficient to have the database perform the filtering for us. We propose moving the draft attribute out of the XML blob and storing it in a dedicated column in the table. This would for example allow us to efficiently query for a student's most recent non-draft submission for the instructor view.

Compatibility:
If a new draft column is introduced, we need to deal with legacy submissions. Some options include:
* Introducing an attribute (call it draft_version) on the assignment which determines whether its associated submissions' draft information is stored in the XML blob vs in the draft column. Code would need to determine which is the case and run the appropriate logic.
* Script to read the draft value out of the blob and populate the column for all existing submissions.

But is there interest in the community for the removal of all / most of the XML attributes into designated table columns? Considering the proposal to extract the 'draft' attribute from XML into its own column, and introduce a 'draft_version' column to maintain legacy data, if we then discover that we need similarly to extract other attributes, we would continue introducing new 'version' attributes for each attribute we want to pull out of the XML. It would be best to do it all at once, and either do a full conversion of existing rows, or set the version attribute one time for legacy vs current.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,,,,"0|108pjs:",9223372036854775807,,,,,Not started,,,,,,,"26-Oct-2016 10:55;jonespm;[~bbailla2] Hey Brian, there is interest in converting the XML into columns.

To facilitate this, the gradebook should provide a display and export option to produce a table for each assignment showing by group, the TA, and the highest, lowest and average grade given.

This allows a course convenor or assessment moderator to determine if grading has been consistent across groups, and to apply moderation strategies if required.

Therefore, a instructor, in order to view which students need to be graded (have at least a submission that has not been graded), he needs to 'click the triangle icon beside a student to view the status for all assignments' for each student.

For that reason, We've had several suggestions that indicate that it is very painful for an instructor to move through the whole list in order to check which students are ready to be graded. Therefore, our suggestion is that it will be useful to add some kind of 'sign/mark' with a Legend at the top to indicate which students have submissions without a grade. Maybe having a (*) next the name of those students that have new submissions and are ready to be graded.

After a Signup meeting is created with multiple time slots, a instructor might need to block one or more time slots for personal reasons without wanting to change the configuration of the meeting. The same way that a Instructor (or role with the right permissions) can access the meeting and use the funtionality 'Add participant' for selecting a student for an specific time slot, it would be interesting to have the ability of blocking that time slot without needind to select a user from that list. Instructor could maybe introduce a 'text' that represents the why that time slot is blocked.

ie: International student visit

A common use case is to use one of those time slots for a different student that might not be in that class (therefore not in the site) and the instructor just want to block that time slot introducing a name that it is not in the current site members list. Instructor could just type the name of the student and the slot would be blocked and not available for other students.

ie:  last minute meeting

Instructor has a last minute meeting and want to block one of the free slots to make sure that non of the students and sign-up for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"17-Mar-2015 05:01;jmariano;signup-feature request.jpg;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/42516/signup-feature+request.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,,,,"0|108j5k:",9223372036854775807,,,,,Not started,,,,,,,"17-Mar-2015 05:05;jmariano;Not a bug, its a feature request but can't change the type for this jira :(","25-Mar-2016 08:50;ncaidin;Done, moved this issue to a feature request.

It would integrate with many of the other tools in Sakai. 

You'd be able to see a list of badges you have unlocked, and there would be an info screen for each of your badge unlocks that also showed the date and qualifier for unlocking that badge, if appropriate. For example, if you unlocked the badge 'I got my first A', it would say something like ""For assignment 'The History of Sakai' in XYZ class"". This would be visible to the badge owner only.

You would also be able to see which of your connections also had unlocked the same badge, but not their qualifiers. Maybe this could be a privacy setting to control it's visibility so that you could also share this.

Profile2 already has the Kudos feature whereby you get a calculated score for using Profile2 lots, this would be an extension.

Chuck alerted me to a project that looks to standardise this (https://wiki.mozilla.org/Badges), but it may be a while off. Work would not be lost though, the implementation would be swappable for this other Badge project's API. Referring to the diagram about halfway down that page, Sakai would become a badge issuer, Profile2 would display the badge backpack. Then badges from other systems would be visible in Sakai as well.

What do you think?

If this is a goer, would anyone with some graphical design skills be interested in creating some badges?

I'm also interested in what badges we should have. Get back to me with any ideas!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SAK-23803,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14600,,,PRFL-631,,,"0|103m4w:",21085,,,,,Not started,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The best to do is probably to integrate with the new privacy module introduced in 2.3. I haven't look at the API yet, but it should be straightforward.

I just wanted to let you know why I haven't applied this yet.  This is actually a controversial feature.  There are valid reasons for not wanting a student to be able to mark messages as read without attempting to read them (see the long comment thread on MSGCNTR-9).  I'm trying to figure out the best approach for this (I'm consulting with some others on the msgcntr team).  The top two thoughts are to have this feature disabled by default and turned on via a sakai.property.  Or perhaps it can be tied to the ""Automatically Mark All Messages in a Thread as Read"" setting in Topic Settings so that an instructor can decide (or make it an entirely new option in the settings but I'm not sure if you are up for the work required for that).  I'll get back to you soon.

Another solution is to rely on the fallback to english, if the translation is not found, and in convertStringToDate() handle the possible ParseException and then assume it is in english format.

Thus, to find out the relative weight of each option, you have to do your own calculations. It would be quite handy to have this additional functionality. (This should be a feature request and not a bug report).

Two additional options will be needed to automate calculating relative weights: 

# an option to enable calculating relative weights v simple percentages would allow for the most flexibility
# an option to specify the number of points allotted to each voter 

This use case illustrates the criteria and calculations needed for relative weighting:

* Instructor wants to give students an opportunity to indicate their preferences for a range of options and allot points to each student's vote to be distributed across *selected* options (e.g., if a student selects only one option, that option receives all of the points from that student's vote; if another student selects 2 options, each selected option receives 50% of the points, and so on).
* Each student who votes may select a single or multiple options (up to 4 in this particular use case). Thus, the instructor configures the poll question to allow selection of 1 minimum response and 4 maximum responses.
* The resulting percentages for each option would reflect:
*# The number of voters multiplied by the number of points allotted to each voter returns the Total Points.
*# At each option level, divide the number of votes received by the total number of votes 
*# Multiply the resulting percentage found in the previous step by the Total Points to find the relative weight of each option in the voting spread and display this value in the Percentages column.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"26-Feb-2011 07:33;psg3a@virginia.edu;polls-erroneous-results.jpg;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/24877/polls-erroneous-results.jpg","26-Feb-2011 07:44;psg3a@virginia.edu;polls-relative-weight-results.jpg;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/24878/polls-relative-weight-results.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14643,,,"SAK-20141, POLL-147",,,"0|103meg:",21128,,,,,Not started,,,,,,,"08-Aug-2013 09:31;smarquard;Unassigning because David is not available to work on this project in the near future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allow an institution to set Syllabus ""items"" as ""Expanded"" by default. There are often times where it is beneficial to present a user with body text without requiring the user to click on the item first to expand it. In Sakai 2.9, since there were no collapsible items, all items could be considered expanded by default. This possibility should be returned in the form of a toggle setting for each Syllabus item.

2. Users currently can only expand 1 or all items. It is not possible to expand more than 1 and less than all. If you click on one item, any other expanded item will collapse. If you include an ""Expand All"" feature, it makes sense that the user would also be able to expand 2 items if they choose to do so. Items should not be collapsed unless they are clicked again while expanded. It is currently possible to expand 2 items simultaneously by clicking ""Expand All"" and then collapsing each item individually, but this is cumbersome.

Please see the attached screenshot to see what I believe should be a possible default view. When a student clicks on Syllabus, it should be possible that they are taken immediately to this view without needing to click anything.

They usually like how submissions are marked and differentiated when they are graded (with the 'Grade' column) and when released to students with the column 'Released'. The proposal would be to add a new column that shows when a submission has already been commented by the instructor. This should not affect any of the information displayed in the other two columns. It will follow the same logic that it is used for grading assignments. The main idea is that they can see from then main page how many submissions have already been commented and which ones they might have on the queue.

Please, consider taking a look at the screenshot to better understand the functionality. We could have all this different scenarios.

 - Empty submission
 - Empty submission with comments from the instructor (SHOW NEW COMMENT'S ICON)
 - Submission with comments and with grade (not released yet) (SHOW NEW COMMENT'S ICON)
 - Submission with comments and with grade released to student (SHOW NEW COMMENT'S ICON)

If it is excluded from indexing.

If it is a resource, we dont claim responsibility for the resource, so it will not be added to the index.
If it is a collection, we find all child nodes and put a delete statement for them in the queue.

The queue is processed.

To determine if a resource is to be excluded, we look at is and its ancestors, and if are allowed to be indexed the resource can be indexed.

We will have to perform a filter on the Rebuild operations to exclude entities that have been excluded from indexing.

1. For email address validation, how about EmailValidator.isValid from commons-validator, rather than a split and length check. It's actually already in the imports.
2. The user type should be configurable, perhaps being included as a field in the uploaded file or maybe as a sakai property. It's current hardcoded as ""guest"" which may not be relevant for some institutions.
3. The password for a new user get generated, do they get an email about it?
4. Is it possible to supply the password in the uploaded file?

*Settings*

The distinction between *Immediate Feedback* (i.e. students can click a link WHILE in the process of taking the assessment) and *Feedback on Submission* (students get feedback immediately after submitting the assessment) is not very clear. Additionally, if *Feedback on Submission* is selected, the _student's_ samigo screen displays the text _Immediate_ in reference to the feedback they can view. Upon selecting *Immediate Feedback*, I suggest that the following text should display styled in a red warning box on the _Settings_ screen to clarify the *Immediate Feedback* option:
 * _Feedback can be viewed by students while they take the assessment. Students can change their responses accordingly._

*Question Editing*

In the assessment _Edit_ screens, where you author questions, if you have *Question-Level Feedback* or *Both* enabled in the _Settings_, you have text boxes with the following labels for auto-scored questions (e.g. _Calculated Question_, _Fill in the Blank_, _Matching_, _Multiple Choice_, _Numeric Response_, _True False_):
 * *Correct Answer (optional)*
 * *Incorrect Answer (optional)*

Instructors don't always understand that *Correct Answer (optional)* means: _This is what displays in Feedback when the student selects the correct answer option_. Rather, they enter the correct answer in the box, thinking it displays for students who answer _incorrectly_ and vice versa. I suggest the following change to the field labels:

This would allow an instructor to publish a course site at a specific time and date.  This could alleviate the problem of instructors not publishing the course when they should and forget to do so. Instructors could set the date and rely on the date settings, much like how Assignments are not available to students until the date and time they're made available.

I would suggest a change of the options to read in this sequence:

* links take you to a new page (navigation)
* buttons perform some action on the current page

In this context, the 'Add Roster(s)' is taking you to a new page, so I would leave it as a link.

The 'Add Gradebook Item' scenario is a little different: it doesn't take you to a new page, it produces a modal dialogue window on the same page, and uses a button accordingly (no navigation away form the page in this case).","21-Aug-2019 11:59;alanregan;Thanks for this guideline, Brian.  I'm not sure that this is consistent throughout Sakai, though. Thus far, I can only find a slim number of instances where there are links for significant action items.  All other interface items for a major action (to add something) are either tabs or buttons. 
 * Announcements: ""Add"" = tab (screen reloads and new page displays)
 * Assignments: ""Add"" = tab (screen reloads and new page displays)
 * Gradebook: ""Add Gradebook Item"" = button (modal opens)
 * Syllabus: ""Add Item"" = tab (modal opens)
 * Lessons: ""Add Content"" = tab (modal opens and new page is displayed for the action)
 * Messages: ""Compose Message"" = tab (page reloads a new page is displayed)
 * Polls: ""Add"" = tab... and also ""Add"" = link with old interface icon (duplicate UI elements – new page displays on click)
 * Resources: ""Actions"" = button (menu opens and new page displays based on selection)
 * Rubrics: ""Add Rubric"" = button (inline element displays on same page)
 * Section Info: ""Add Sections"" = tab (page reloads and tabbed page displays)
 * Sign Up: ""Add"" = tab (page reloads and new page displays)
 * Tests & Quizzes: ""Add"" = tab / ""Actions"" = button

The only instances I've found thus far of links for significant actions or elements are:
 * Forums: ""Add Forum"" = tab / ""Add Topic"" = link (next to the link to the forum)
 * Statistics: ""Reports"" = tab / ""Add"" = link (but also old icons and layout)

I feel like using the tab button beneath a tab bar would not be a good choice. A button feels right and matches many of the existing user interface conventions throughout Sakai since this is an action item (vs. viewing something).

So I would argue that adding something is a significant action.  I think this is an interface where a button would be appropriate.

My opinion, of course!","21-Aug-2019 12:03;bjones86;I'm not suggesting that we have any consistency in Sakai. Rather, I'm stating that good design practises encourage links for navigation and buttons for actions.

That said, I'm all for consistency in Sakai, but changing this from a link to a button seems like the wrong approach to achieve said consistency. In my opinion, the link here is a more appropriate choice than a button.

In a perfect world, the link would actually be a tab (more consistent with the rest of the Site Info tool). However, this is complicated by the fact that certain sub-projects of site-manage (Site Info) are written in different frameworks. For instance, the landing page and Manage Participants (as well as some others) are written in Velocity, including the tabs you normally see on the landing page. Some of the other sub-tools are written in RSF, like Manage Groups, Manager Rosters, etc. It also leads to the problem you eluded to, in that it would be strange to have two levels of tabs, or tabs that mysteriously appear and disappear depending on which sub-tool you're in.","23-Aug-2019 13:38;alanregan;Thanks, Brian.  I'm grateful for the dialog and I'm learning a lot!

There is definitely a lot of debate on the Internet on this topic. I like the description here:
{quote}*Clickable actions*: Use buttons to signal clickable actions, such as “download,” “sign up,” or “log out.” You may use links for less popular or less important actions. If you want something that looks and acts like a button, try to always use the {{button}} element rather than styling a link like a button.

??[http://web-accessibility.carnegiemuseums.org/content/buttons/]??
{quote}
In this example, I would consider ""Add Roster(s)"" as a clickable action. It's one of the most important actions on the page after someone clicks ""Edit Class Roster(s)."" Aside from viewing which rosters are present, the main actions are ""add"" or ""remove.""

That said – long-term – it sounds like the standards you reference prefer that a modal window opens?

To me, it doesn't matter whether I go to a new page or view the subsequent action in a modal window.  I'd want to be able to recognize an interactive element and be able to see (or hear from a screen reader) that the element is important in the context of the main content. This item is not a minor task; it's often the main reason to visit the feature. In fact, it may be best represented as a blue button rather than a gray button, but that may be a discussion for another day. :)

Perhaps the UX group can review? I would like to participate in that discussion.","26-Aug-2019 13:45;sfoster9;I agree with [~alanregan] that the link could become more prominent. I agree with [~bjones86] about the links versus buttons, but we haven't officially defined this differentiation yet in the style guide (hopefully one day!). 

I'll open this issue for further discussion for now. ","21-Oct-2019 09:39;profmikegreene;Add roster is a primary action and the only create action a user can take on this screen. Should be a primary button IMO.","08-Oct-2020 18:15;alanregan;With all of the actions related to updating the skins of Sakai recently, perhaps this is a good time to resurface this item?

I still feel strongly that this needs to be a button, not a link.  It is the primary action on this page – and the main reason why our professors come to the tool.  As a link, it's commonly overlooked and can be hard to find, especially in its placement so close to the table of any existing rosters of a site.  When we train new professors, they comment that this feature was difficult to see or find.  They all expected a button or something more obvious. 

Put another way, Site Info > Manage Participants... do you make ""Update Participants"" a link or a button?  It's a button.  Therefore, I feel that ""Add Roster(s)"" should also be a button.

[~profmikegreene] - based on the new skin, if ""Add Roster(s)"" was made a button, what type of button would it become?  A blue one like ""Update Participants"" on the ""Manage Participants"" page?  Or a white button like ""Add Gradebook Item"" in Gradebook (when there is at least one gradebook item already on the page)?

States to consider:
 # Empty state: when no roster exists
 # When at least one roster exists

h1. *EMPTY STATE: WHEN NO ROSTER EXISTS*

Looking at the empty state approach of the Gradebook, it feels like the Add Roster(s) button should be blue.  I created a mockup below.

!image-2020-10-08-16-11-18-701.png!

 
h1. *WHEN AT LEAST ONE ROSTER EXISTS*

The layout changes when at least one roster is attached to the site.  I am not sure whether a white or blue button would be appropriate in this state.  Based on the Gradebook model, the button should be white.  Other pages have blue buttons to indicate the primary action.  I created mockups with the two options.

 # Allow the checklist items to link to elements that are NOT REQUIRED (thereby allowing the student to maintain control of the checkbox.)
 # Allow checklist items to link to MORE types of Sakai content including Text Blocks, Embedded Material blocks, subpages and other content types on the Lessons pages.

 # Enter title and body text
 # In *Availability* select *Specify dates* option
 # *Beginning* and *Ending* options appear with an enable checkbox to the left and date/time picker to right.

Lessons - Allow instructor to customize the title attribute description for tool menu pages,SAK-44160,88362,New Feature,OPEN,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project.

BACKGROUND

A Sakai community member asked whether it would be possible to modify the title attribute (on hover tooltip) for individual Lessons pages that appear in the left tool menu.

""Does anyone know of a way to get to this message that shows on hover over a Lessons page to modify it to good purpose (like providing the student a short description of the page)?""

!lessons-menu-example-tooltip.png!

[https://groups.google.com/a/apereo.org/d/msg/sakai-user/k6NBYKlUGrM/qQscR55YAAAJ]
h2. REQUEST

Offer a way for a professor to modify the tool description for an individual Lessons page. Currently, the tooltip repeats the description of the tool from the Manage Tools page (i.e. ""Lessons - For creating, organizing, and delivering content modules and sequences, such as by week or unit""). The goal would be for an instructor to provide a short purpose or direction for learners when the tooltip is displayed. 
h2. POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS
h3. Manage Tools

When an instructor adds a new Lessons page, perhaps offer a description field that would replace the default tool description for the new instance of Lessons?  Site Info > Manage Tools > select Lessons > Continue > enter name for Lessons page and also the description.

!siteinfo-managetools-lessons-desc.png!
h3. Tool Order

Once a Lessons page is added, if an instructor made a spelling mistake there needs to be a way to edit the description.

Perhaps in addition to ""Edit Tool Title,"" there could be an ""Edit Tool Description"" for Lessons tools?
h3. Lessons

In Lessons, an instructor can rename a Lessons menu item through the main page settings (gear icon) of the Lessons page.

Below the ""Page title"" field, perhaps add ""Page description"" field for top-level Lessons pages?  (Subpages have item description fields, but a top-level page would need a different option to impact the tool name title attribute?)
h2. CONCERNS

There is an accessibility concern to this request since the title attribute is not universally accessible for screen readers or other assistive technologies. If the content is important for all learners, the appropriate solution should be explored to offer access to this information without hindering the user experience when using assistive technologies (i.e. don't repeat the same detail twice).
h2. ADDITIONAL NOTES

The tool label feature was created years ago, starting in Sakai 2.4. See SAK-10120. An update happened later for versions Sakai 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9. See SAK-20645.

Per the notes in these tickets, an institution can control the display of these tool descriptions.  Per ticket SAK-10120, ""This is easy to disable in the includePageNav.vm - but this does also add a title tag for use by screen readers."" Since I am not a developer, I am not sure if the property or setting to enable/disable this feature has changed.  If this option exists, then institutions could turn off the tooltips altogether if desired.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SAK-44182,,,,,,,,,"26-Aug-2020 17:44;alanregan;lessons-menu-example-tooltip.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/56689/lessons-menu-example-tooltip.png","26-Aug-2020 16:48;alanregan;siteinfo-managetools-lessons-desc.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/56688/siteinfo-managetools-lessons-desc.png",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,,,,"0|10c9bc:",9223372036854775807,,,,,Not started,,,,,,,"27-Aug-2020 07:20;tgolightly@johnsonu.edu;This could be a useful tool tip to a user on hover using keyboard or assistive technology to help affirm they are going to the page they intend.

The neither option shows no information next to the names of the users, so it could be renamed to ""Name Only"" or ""None"".

Use of the Question function in Lessons is great for providing opportunities to students on grasp of content - esp. ahead of high-stakes assessments.  However, being able to allow students the opportunity to re-try the question would be beneficial.  Courses using the Question function as part of a student grade, could provide students more than once opportunity to take (do) the question, should they get the answer wrong.

Alternatively you could provide an option for students to earn an 'event' point, so that even if the student gets the answer wrong, they're awarded a point for having done the question.  This sort of self-check is really good for 'in content' review, esp. in online courses, where progress thresholds are used.

One property could allow for unlimited attempts to the question, until the student correctly answers the question. Or there could be a property as you suggest to have instructors allow a certain number of attempts until the student is permitted to go on. Or there could be a sort of ""allow retake"" option like what exists in T&Q. Regardless of the method it should be simple to implement and easy for an instructor or TA to administrate. 

Perhaps out of the box the default behavior is unlimited attempts.

An option might provide ""Grade this item and allow 3 attempts"" and then release the next items. This bears out some thinking because it could (like other items - such as requiring a student to post to a forum or get a certain grade on a quiz in T&Q) get really complicated to implement - just in the UX interface workflow. !Screen Shot 2020-08-06 at 6.27.03 PM.png!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I forwarded your questions to the instructor who brought up this inquiry and asked for his use-case.  Below is his response:

“Regarding hiding assignments, it occurred to me this semester when I had a class with lots of assignments that had accumulated by the end of the semester (8-10). When I added the final two paper assignments I thought it would be nice to hide the earlier ones, now closed—to simplify the list for a cleaner look—so that students would only see the assignments that remained for the semester—perhaps a small but useful way to help them focus on remaining tasks.

The assignments could be deleted but to have records of them would require downloading them all. For short assignments, I don’t always download them because I can read them quickly when I open them in *VeriCite.

In addition, hiding them would prevent the need to keep reordering the assignments by due date, as I like to have them in reverse chronological order by due date.”

 

*VeriCite is the plagiarism tool we use for those that don’t know.

 

From my perspective, I think the idea to have this feature request https://jira.sakaiproject.org/browse/SAK-41722 will certainly help prevent the downloading of any attachments and/or instructions from the assignment after the student submits.

Another interpretation was to support different paths through the course where an Instructor may give students the option of completing 2 out of 5 choices and wants the choices to appear in the same two grade columns?

OVERVIEW

Allow an instructor to quickly navigate to the next or previous assignment, similar to how an instructor can grade the next or previous student within an assignment.
h1. BACKGROUND

As an instructor, I must click ""Grade"" or ""View submissions"" under an assignment title to see the student names.  On this page, if I want to go directly to the next assignment, I must reset the tool or click ""Assignment List,"" click ""Grade"" or ""View Submissions"" under the title of the next assignment (and possibly have to scroll down if there are many assignments), and then I will reach the same screen for the next assignment to grade students.
h1. REQUEST

To save instructors two clicks, two screen refreshes, and likely some scrolling, why not have a ""Next Assignment"" button at the top right?

For consistency, perhaps Previous, Return to List, and Next buttons with clear indication that the instructor would be moving between assignments (not navigating the user list of the existing assignment).

The feature request here is to modify the language of the word ""Assignment"" in the first option, which reads: ""Display *assignment* statistics to students."" 

The word ""assignment"" seems like a bit of a misnomer, as the statistics will display for ALL graded activities in the Gradebook, not just for ""assignments"" (or grades being pushed from the Assignments tool). That is, whether the items were created manually or are being pushed from the myriad assortment of tools in Sakai (e.g. Tests & Quizzes, Attendance, Forums, and also Assignments), the statistics options will show for each gradebook item (i.e. each graded activity). 

I am proposing language like:

 ** I would propose the appropriate ARIA labelledby or describedby method: [https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/instructions/#using-aria-labelledby]
 ** NOTE: I decided against the ""placeholder"" text approach within the form fields due to concerns about accessibility. I am not opposed to this option and personally find the approach more elegant but wanted to err toward accessibility over elegance in this situation.

Resources - Trash - Suggestion to improve the main heading,SAK-42303,85982,New Feature,Awaiting Review,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project.

CONCERN

When an instructor or maintain user of a site selects ""Trash"" within ""Resources,"" the top of the page says ""Restoring items."" There are two features for Trash: Restore or Remove. The heading does not reflect the feature accurately and does not follow patterns for other tools/features in the system.
h1. SUGGESTION

Since the feature is called ""Trash"" why not simply change the page heading from ""Restoring items"" to ""Trash""? For example, when someone clicks ""Permissions"" from the main page of ""Resources,"" the resulting page says ""Permissions"" at the top.

When files are present in the Trash, an instruction box explains that the user can select file(s) and click ""Restore"" to restore files. While I will create a separate ticket to improve this instruction (since there is no mention of the Remove button), this instruction box will guide users.

I feel that the title of the page should reflect the functionality name/label, so I propose that the name should be updated to ""Trash.""

There may be other locations in the ""Statistics"" tool or administrative ""Sitestats Admin"" where the icons need to be updated.

In Statistics > Overview...
 * Since the ""Visits"" icon looks like a single person, I selected the ""User"" FontAwesome icon (vs. the ""Users"" icon which is used by the Roster tool).
 * For the Activity icon, I chose the Bar Chart option, so that we reserve the pie chart for the main Statistics tool itself.
 * For Resources, I chose the same icon that Resources uses since that seems logical to me.
 * For ""Lessons Pages,"" I chose the same icon that Lessons uses since that seems logical to me.
 * NOTE: This page may be a prime candidate for a tabbed approach or an alternate layout of the information? For example, would vertical ""cards"" work better than horizontal bars?

In Statistics > ""Reports"" or Sitestats Admin > ""Admin Reports""...
 * There is currently a green plus-sign icon next to a link for ""Add""ing an item.
 * I propose removing the icon and replacing the underlined link with a standard action button for ""Add."" If the community has a different standard for this (tab or button), then adopt the common standard.

Inside a custom or pre-defined report...
 * Replace the older icons with the equivalent FontAwesome icon for the appropriate tool.

When creating a custom report...
 * Since there seems to be a movement toward tabbed paging, consider whether a tabbed approach (each tab is the heading for the content) might be a good fit? The content could potentially be consolidated into three tabs: About (for title and description), Details (What, When, Who), and Results (How the data should be presented)?
 * Else, perhaps simply remove the icons if they serve no purpose? (Just as when creating an assignment in the Assignments tool there are headings but no icons next to the headings?)
 * Determine whether the current page design (with horizontal rules and very small description text to the right of the heading) follows the standards for the system or if the layout should be updated to new standards.

I hope these notes explain the choices I made in the test plan. The community can change or update as desired. I added the ""UX"" label to this ticket for additional eyes and feedback.

Change Hidden/Course Grade Calculation Icons to buttons,SAK-42000,85577,New Feature,Awaiting Review,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project.

There would also have to be appropriate text alternatives for the buttons to indicate the current state and the state that would result from selecting one of them, e.g.:

Gradebook item not included in course grade calculation. Click to include item grades.","24-Jun-2019 14:20;tkelsey2;I agree that the buttons could be made larger, if you look at the mockup I did they are a bit bigger. There isn't much else going on in that box so it should be fine to make them larger? This would also help for users who can't distinguish the color change to see the slash on the icons. 

Is there an alt property you could give to the icons/buttons that would help with the current state? And that could probably be made into a tooltip as well.","24-Jun-2019 14:35;rainribbon;All the icons already have information that pops up on focus, e.g.:
* *Calculator with slash:* Gradebook item not included in course grade calculation.
* *Eyeball:* Gradebook item is not visible to students.
* *Paper:* Gradebook item coming from Assignments. 
* *Lock:* Go to the [tool name] tool to edit scores for this item.

The difference would be if they are buttons, they will need additional text to indicate their current vs. potential states.  In the mockup, I think the buttons are a bit too large and distract from the other items on the page.  They draw my eye to them more than the text of the students' grades.

If any of the icons in the cell are made larger, I also think the menu (down arrow icon) should be made more prominent - it's hard to see already.","24-Jun-2019 15:05;tkelsey2;I think the button size can definitely be edited, and I agree that the menu should be larger. My point was really just that there is room for a button which is easy to click in that area. 

If the colors are too eye catching, we might have to consider a better way to show that they are in one state or the other, as the slash can be hard to see if the icon is too small

Editing the information about current/potential states should be relatively simple correct? I have no idea really but it doesn't seem like it would be a huge issue to me.","24-Jun-2019 16:27;rainribbon;Yeah, to me, the colors used in the mockup are too eye-catching, but they might not be visible to some colorblind users.

I think the challenge will be making the state (visible/hidden and included in course grade or not) apparent at-a-glance to a sighted user - modifying the alt text/tooltips shouldn't be too hard because the text is already there.

The other thing is that there are also icons in those cells if a gradebook item is sent from an external tool (Assignments, Lessons, Tests & Quizzes).  The corresponding icon displays to the left of the item title.","25-Jun-2019 07:59;tkelsey2;So perhaps we could use duller versions of red and green instead? And then make the slash more visible for color blind users.

Do the icons next to the title affect the overall layout of the cell? Like will those icons make it difficult to see the buttons which we would be adding?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Starting out inside a CKEditor may be particularly disorienting for screen reader users because it is my understanding that screen readers start reading instructions for using the editor as soon as you are focused in the editor's text area.

Commentors, please feel free to provide use cases and tools for consideration.

I'd recommend something a little less scary, for example:

{quote}","29-Apr-2019 09:30;lgekeler;I'd like to play devil's advocate for a moment... from the instructor's point of view, why would there be any reason to be UNable to alter group membership up to the point when actual submissions have been received for the assignment from at least one group? If we are supporting online, blended and supplementary course design, then it seems to me the better solution is to ALLOW changing group membership even after Posting, but only up to the point when the first submission is received.

Instructors should know what they're doing and communicate appropriately to students. If we think they need their memories jogged about that, then we could augment with helpful text.

Please consider the requirements of the linked JIRA when designing how group submissions/group locking should work. SAK-41515","29-Apr-2019 10:45;rainribbon;The main issue with NOT being able to change the groups, even after submissions have been made, is that if the assignments are created while students can still add and drop the course, instructors may need to move students in and out of groups to balance the membership numbers.  I don't think it would be too unusual for one group, which has a set number of members, to submit, and shortly after that, a different group, which hasn't submitted yet, may need to have its membership changed or an entirely new group might need to be added to the assignment to submit it.

Some departments allow adding/dropping for a much longer period of time than others. If an instructor wants to add a newly-enrolled student to an existing group, they won't be able to do that.

Another potential use case for allowing group membership to change after an assignment is created would be to allow students to join their own groups. An instructor might create several groups to present on different topics, and allow the students to pick a topic by joining the appropriate group. I know an instructor who does this very successfully with _Lessons_ Student Pages, but a similar assignment isn't possible in _Assignments_ due to the bad behavior of the dummy submissions.

There's also the case referred to in SAK-41515, where an instructor may want to set up and publish assignments at the beginning of the semester, and then add students to empty groups to submit the assignment later.","30-Apr-2019 12:36;lgekeler;[~rainribbon] These are excellent points. We wouldn't need to disallow changing groups after a submission. But if we did that, should we check to disallow a student from a group which already has a submission from joining another one?","30-Apr-2019 14:58;rainribbon;In the case of joinable groups, I think that's something the instructor should manage in the group settings, i.e., either the instructor sets up the groups originally so they can't be unjoined once joined, or after allowing a reasonable amount of time for students to choose their groups and move from group to group (before they start the assignment), the instructor modifies the group settings so students can't unjoin their group.

If we allow group membership to be changed after assignments have been submitted, but implement specific logic to prevent a member of a group that already submitted an assignment from being moved to another group, I think we'll need to carefully consider different use cases.  For example:
# I assume this logic should apply exclusively to *group submissions* assignments.  If not, there are potential issues for roster groups being assigned to complete specific assignments (e.g., students in each discussion section in a large lecture course may be assigned to submit to different copies of the same assignment on different days). If a student submits while on one roster during the add-drop period of the course, then switches enrollment to a different roster, their group and the assignments they can submit will change.
# What happens if, during the add/drop period, all but one member of a group that submitted drop the course? Should we prevent the instructor from adding that one student into another existing group for future assignments?
# A specific student might fail to contribute work to an assignment, even if it has been submitted by their other group members. Should the instructor be unable to move that student to a group containing classmates with whom they might work better?","01-May-2019 09:17;hauerwas@providence.edu;Discussed on the 5/1 Teaching & Learning Call.

I agree that we should perhaps revisit the underlying issue – that of group locking.  But until the underlying issue is addressed (in a separate, related jira?) I'd recommend adding the textual caution sooner rather than later.

[~rainribbon], I liked your proposal – slight modifications below:

Allow Instructors to Customize Tool Icon for PostEm tool,SAK-41716,85276,New Feature,OPEN,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project.

That said, the PostEm tool in Sakai currently allows instructors to post different types of feedback for students. Examples include: a) grades, b) attendance, c) comments, d) a combination of these, or d) any other creative use-cases not mentioned here. Given the latitude of how instructors can utilize this tool for courses, it ought to be possible for the instructor to select an alternative tool icon that reflects the way he/she is using it.

For example, perhaps an instructor wishes to use the PostEm tool as a way to post student grades. In this case, the instructor may wish to select a tool icon that matches this objective. The current icon – a folded post-it-note – does not necessarily communicate this purpose.

Currently, the ""Web Content tool"" allows instructors to customize the tool icon for their own purposes. This makes sense, given the different use cases that the Web Content tool supports. By extension, the proposal here is that the same ought to be true for the PostEm tool.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,,,,"0|10btow:",9223372036854775807,,Please add a Test Plan here.,,,Not started,,,,,,,"30-Apr-2019 10:35;sfoster9;It seems that the Web Content is a unique tool (like BasicLTI) that allows site maintainers to be able to change the icon. 

If we start adding the ability to change tool icons, I think we want to look at a more holistic approach done through Site Info > Tool Order rather than through each tool's Settings or Edit page.

I've added the SWITCH label so it can be made consistent across tools.

There are also pedagogical implications of changing icons: based on feedback we've collected locally from students, they don't like when instructors customize their course sites too much because it is so different from their other sites. Since instructors can already rename and reorder tools, and use different tools (e.g. Lessons vs Resources for presenting content), custom icons for tools is yet another difference that students will have to deal with. ","30-Apr-2019 10:52;jbuckin2;Hi Shawn,

I do agree wholeheartedly that the icons behind the more well-known, standardized tools (like Assignments, Gradebook, Forums, Site Info, Overview, Lessons, etc.) should +_not_+ be customizable, precisely for the reason you stated.

However, at the very least, for a tool like the PostEm tool, whose purpose is ultimately defined by the instructor, it seems that there should be some ability to customize the icon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""DownloadAll"" indeed creates grades.csv file. We can confirm that when we open it with a text editor like notepad, comma delimiters are shown with data.

When we open the grades.csv file with the default editor on Windows for CSV files: Excel, it appears Excel properly parsed the comma delimiters. However, as soon as user edits the grades file and hit the save button (or Ctrl+S), Excel silently saves the file as tab delimited instead of keeping the comma delimiters that we exported by Sakai. You can check this change by opening the saved grades file with notepad before exiting Excel. All comma delimiters are replaced with tab delimiters. Once you try to close Excel, it will inform you that you have not saved your file (even though you did), and if you choose Yes to save again, it will try to create a TXT file named grades.csv.txt and save it as tab delimited. If you force the overwrite of grades.csv without changing the drop down to CSV, it will happily save a tab delimited file over the CSV format.

 

We are sure that that's why the upload all files complaint and cannot be successfully done. If user saves the grades file as ""Comma delimiter"" type manually (which is cumbersome), then csv format also works fine with upload all feature. This appears to be Excel mangling the file, and not an actual issue in Sakai.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

-If the assignment is closed but resubmissions are allowed, students can send resubmissions (as many as limited by configuration) but meanwhile instructors can't send any submission on behalf of students

-If the assignment is closed, instructors can't send submissions on behalf of students but they can overpass this easily, changing the due date of the assignment. This is not a good workaround IMHO, because if assignment is visible by students they could send another submission out of time.

FEATURE REQUEST:

Consider adding a few more icons into the mix for Resources. This way, an instructor can quickly see the state of a file or folder without having to dive into ""Edit Details"" to check. The ""Hidden"" icon is critical but covered in -----SAK-40132-----.

The additional suggestions below I feel will enhance the instructor experience (Locked, Calendar, Group), but I have marked this ticket as minor. 
 * Locked: SAK-40583
 * Calendar (Date Restriction): SAK-40581
 * Conditional Release: SAK-40582
 * Group: SAK-40584
 * Edited Folder Permissions: SAK-40590

As a reminder, the other existing icons are: 
 * Copyright symbol (fa-copyright) in the event the flag ""Display copyright alert..."" was enabled.
 * Information circle (fa-info-circle) if a description has been entered.

The available states that I am aware of for the ""Access"" field are:
 * Entire Site (default)
 * Public
 * Logged in users
 * Select group(s)

The order hierarchy for any icons should be as follows:
 * Copyright
 * Information
 * Visibility (Hidden or Locked)
 * Date release
 * Conditional release
 * Group

Please see the sub-tasks for details on each item.

For performance, I can see the icons not being used when using the ""Copy Content from My Other Sites"" feature. If a user has many sites and many files, disabling the display of the additional icons might speed up performance? Something to be considered when evaluating the addition of icons in Resources.

Thank you for considering this feature request.

It would be nice to be able to pin select favorites to always be at the top of the list.  For example, as a system administrator, pinning the ""Administrative Workspace"" site so that any new sites do not bump it down the tab list. As an instructor, I have a project site with shared Resources to which I also would like to have quick access.  If I was able to pin or freeze those two sites to always be next to Home, then other favorite sites could cycle in and out without issues.

My thought on the user interface would be for this functionality to exist in the ""Organize Favorites"" area of the portal ""Sites"" feature.  On the ""Organize Favorites"" tab in Sites, I don't know if there would simply be a box called ""Pinned Sites"" that is empty by default until a site is dragged into it, or if there is a pin icon that when clicked moves the site into a Pinned box, etc.  Since I can't think of a use-case where the fifth site would always we frozen in the fifth position, that's why I wonder if it's best to have a box for all pinned sites.  Within the Pinned sites box, I could reorder and the system would keep anything exactly as I set it.  Below, the standard favorites would be listed and would be sorted automatically by created date, if the automatic favorite feature is enabled.  Pinning a site would always be a manual selection (whether via keyboard or mouse).

Since I am not a UI designer or UX expert, I am hoping others would have ideas on the best way to allow someone to freeze sites so that the auto-favorite feature doesn't bump commonly used sites (and people aren't always reordering sites if they want a few sites fixed).

Since I believe that Sakai 12 is in code freeze, I have associated this with Sakai 13.

*OVERVIEW*
With the ability of an instructor to mark a question as ""extra credit,"" the question remains -- how does this impact the total points earned in relation to the total points possible?  Should an assessment's total points earned cap at 100% or allow for greater than 100%?

*REQUEST*
Please allow an assessment-level setting where a professor can select whether the total points earned by students can exceed (or not) the total points possible.  I would imagine a setting under ""Grading and Feedback"" with a heading of ""Extra Credit"" and a radio button option for either ""Allow extra credit to exceed the total points possible (students can earn more than 100%)"" or ""Do not allow extra credit to exceed the total points possible (students cannot earn more than 100%).""  NOTE: I could also see a checkbox with only one option. I feel that having clear options with explanations may be more user-friendly for an instructor, but I am totally open to community feedback whether radio buttons with the two options or a single checkbox with only one option is best for user experience.

In addition, please allow the institution to set a flag to establish the default behavior for this setting.  I would recommend that the ""out of the box"" (OOTB) default value should be set to exceed 100% (no cap).  I can see the institutional flag(s) offering to either select option A (more than 100%), option B (cap at 100%), disable instructor selection (institution makes the grading choice; setting not displayed in Settings for instructor at all), or even disable extra credit as an option (option to flag question as extra credit removed, no setting for calculation preference).

I mean, in order to avoid messing up th history always, better make it mess just one time.

 

IDK what IDEs use or if sakai developers use it. But as an example, IntelliJ (the one I use) when I trigger a reformat, it takes in consideration the .editorconfig file.

 

Also, I think that the should not vote what coding convention style take. Just take the standard one. ","23-Jul-2018 18:02;jonespm;Well I think there are *some* styles from the original Java sun guides that have a consensus, even in the original Java style guide there wasn't anything for tabs/spaces. And while most things are K&R braces, you'll find a lot of use of Allman braces, especially in javascript. And you'll find a lot of times braces are omitted, mostly for worse. Though I think there's generally 2 alternate styles in use for almost everything in Sakai.

By ""every tool in Sakai"" I mean like Assignments verses Samigo. Different development teams wrote these at different places in different times so they're going to be different. 

Google has a code style, Oracle has a code style, Twitter has a code style, Mozilla has a code style, Sun had a code style. 

https://blog.takipi.com/tabs-vs-spaces-how-they-write-java-in-google-twitter-mozilla-and-pied-piper/

In your sample editor config you have a style of space which only half of Sakai is going to use. 

If you write a new tool from scratch or do a large modifications, it sounds like this is a useful thing to have, but the community should not be randomly reformatting entire files they're working on and changing the existing style of code for small patches.

If we were to do something like this we'd have to take the entire source of Sakai, use git-filter-branch to re-write all of the history with these rules and force push. It doesn't make sense to me to just randomly apply it. It's going to break something either way if this was ever done.

http://jira.sakaiproject.org/browse/SAK-7768 but it looks like this issue has been kicking around since at least the days of 2.0, 2.1. ""

""How about add two new permissions:
   site.upd.site.mbrshp.status
   site.upd.site.mbrshp.role

To see this issue in action, do the following:
 # Go to Gradebook/Settings/Grading Schema
 # Pick an existing Grading Schema (in the attached screen shot I selected a C- grade for 70 points)
 # Create a new Grading Schema entry with the same point value (I created a grade called X)
 # Save your work

You now have ambiguous Grading Schema which will cause the student to see the first of the redundant entries for a grade (if they have point values in that range).  But they won't see the second one.

We found this when upgrading to Sakai 12.1.  Inadvertently, Grading Schema called ""I"" (for incomplete) were added to every course with a point value of zero.  This is ambiguous with the pre-existing F grade, also with a point value of zero.  Any student with a point value that should give them an F grade now sees an I (incomplete) grade instead – sending a very different signal to the student.  Instead of ""you're failing this course"" the message now seems to be ""just finish your work and you'll get a grade.""

Our new instructors are constantly adding gradebook items for assignments and quizzes, then go to assignments and quizzes, and either
1)  Try to add a new gradebook item with the same gradebook item name for the assignments and quizzes (which doesn't work well), or
2) They forget to associate the test/assignment with the gradebook item they created earlier (which causes grades to languish in the tool, never reaching the gradebook).

   ","03-Feb-2017 13:05;medillon;Perhaps our faculty are a little different than your group. Ultimately, we highly encourage faculty to set up the gradebook first so that when they are creating assignments/test & quizzes, they are able to associate with the the item that is pre-existing. Essentially, what this request is asking for is a way to associate knowledge checks to pre-existing gradebook options. This will not add any additional confusion for faculty in theory, it is just adding additional functionality to those who want it. I suppose a way to compromise on this could be to use a ""*Basic*"" and ""*Advanced*"" tab so that faculty/designers can chose which method they wish to proceed with.

If a student doesn't answer or engage with the question at all, there's no way to assign them a zero point valuation. UNLESS you use the ""GIVE ALL NULL ENTRIES a ZERO"" feature of the gradebook. So, in light of [~roehrsb@durhamtech.edu] comment, having the function of adding a gradebook item and linking it, WOULD ALLOW instructors to place a zero w/o making the entire gradebook suffer. Thanks!","15-Mar-2017 08:51;lcira;If we do allow the question grade to be linked to an existing grade item in the gradebook, let's follow the lead of the Assignments tool, which presents the instructor with a dropdown list of existing grade items to link to.

Retracted exam visible to students who have taken it + What about a Feedback Timer?,SAK-34786,51478,New Feature,OPEN,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project.

I understand that my reported issue is ""fixed"" in 2.8.x, but I still agree with Trisha Gordon's comment (from UVa).  It may be in part because she's at a school with a medical program and has faculty struggling with the same issues as my own.  I'm currently helping to support Sakai CLE (Samigo) at a Nursing College.  One of the things that our Nursing Faculty have (legitimately) requested/complained about is the use of the Retract Date.  Essentially, they want to be able to Retract a test for ALL students, not just those who have not taken it.  They also want to submit the request to be able to limit the access to a test by an amount of TIME.

Here's the scenario:
Nursing students eventually take professional exams (NCLEX) upon the end of their schooling.  As part of their education, they become accustomed to taking exams in a similar or same format throughout their courses.  The faculty at MCON do their best to mimic this experience by providing exams (as assessments) to their students that are timed and to some extent ""a surprise.""  Good or bad pedagogy aside, this is the format that is used.

Now, one of the issues that crops up is that faculty want to be able to share the feedback with the students after taking the test, but ONLY FOR A LIMITED TIME, and without having to remember to make setting changes like ""No Feedback"" to the test after the fact.  For example, a nursing instructor would create a test that shows one question at a time that all students could take at X o'clock over a timed period of 1 hour.  That much they can do; however, they would like to be able to set the duration for how long a student would have access to the feedback upon submission.  For some faculty, this would be for 1 hour after submission.  For others, it would be for a week.  For all cases, they want to restrict the access to the tests because of two reasons: (1) they often reuse the questions in tests for subsequent semesters, and (2) they don't want students to be able to access the questions indefinitely.

Now, I've discussed the reasoning for why having access to the questions (and feedback) is a good thing, but I can also understand their reasoning for limited feedback access.  Many of the faculty do know that they can go back in and change the feedback access post-submission, but they often forget to do that.  They also know that students can print off the exams, if so willing.  But what they really want to be able to do is post-submission, go over the exam question by question with the students, and then have the comfort in knowing that the exam questions and feedback has been automatically pulled from the web so that the students will not become accustomed to relying on the information being online but instead will rely on having to memorize and internalize the information, replicating the experience they will have when they must take and pass the NCLEX exam.

So, would there ever be the option or ability to setup ""Retract"" to truly ""Hide from all students"" and/or provide a limited feedback timer?  Is this something that is moot or resolved in Sakai AOE?

This additional database activity can decrease performance and possibly cause deadlocking in itself.

-- Amber D. Evans, VT

Per John C. Duke (Engineering Science & Mechanics at Virginia Tech):

Ideally we would like the questions to include numbers which can be randomized as well as figures related to the questions with labels that can be randomized. We'd also like the module to be able to accept a numerical response and determine if it is correct or not and log a grade/score.

This is an example ""borrowed"" from a textbook (see https://scholar.vt.edu/access/content/user/adevans/images/scholar-problem.pdf), so we realize that due to copyright issues we will need to develop ""original"" problems.  However, this can serve as an example.

What we would like is when student #1 logs onto to tackle the assignment/test that s/he would see what is here.  However, when student  #2 logs on what they would see is the same basic problem except the numbers for TA, TB, TC, TD and perhaps the ""120 mm""  and the ""65 MPa"" would be different.  The values for TA, TB, TC and TD are related so while perhaps some might be selected from a set of values the others need to be computed.  Also the choices for 120mm and 65 MPa for realism ought not to be totally random.  So while we previously indicated ""random"" it might be more appropriate to suggest a large number of different combinations of values.

We could also of course created the artwork for the figure so that the numbers do not appear and that those values are provided in the text of the problem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"20-Jan-2010 19:20;adevans;scholar-problem.pdf;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/19449/scholar-problem.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,36826,,,SAM-619,,,"0|107jww:",44053,,,,,Not started,,,,,,,"20-Jan-2010 19:20;adevans;I am doing some housecleaning of my Scholar My Workspace Resources area and thought you'd still like to have the actual file I originally referenced.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1) Reproduce it, test the fix
2) Check that normal login handling and redirects are not disrupted by this patch
Suggest trying the scenario where user login timeout happens AFTER patch applied and see if user is still properly redirected back to where they were (without an external authentication system). I suspect that may break.


Also, We are curious how this was discovered? Does it happen often (how often)?
","03-Sep-2013 07:43;seanrbaker;I'll probably do best to answer these in reverse...

Locally, we run in a container-authenticated model (using CAS).  Most of our students are now using Apple products for accessing the system, which for most of them means that they never close the tab they have Sakai open in, much less the browser.  This results in a (previously) problematic chain of events for them...
1.) Student is using Sakai actively to study, in lecture, etc.
2.) Student prepares to move to next activity, and simply closes the laptop / locks iPad / etc.
3.) Student does whatever offline students do for at least 60 minutes (session expires).
4.) Student reopens laptop / iPad, usually pulls up their Facebook tab first.
5.) Meanwhile, in the Sakai tab, the presence tool's interval has expired, so it fires and attempts to refresh information.  A chain of events sparked by the portal's Presence Handler's passing of a returnURL causes HELPER_DONE_URL to now be set to the presence URL.
6.) Presence response is a 302, which doesn't actually percolate and reroute the user (IMO, this is desirable).
7.) Eventually either the student attempts to interact with the Sakai tab directly, or the timeout function realizes that the user's session has expired - either way, the user is sent back to the container login.
8.) Upon authentication, HELPER_DONE_URL is followed, and the user is passed into the presence tool results, which is of course meaningless and rather unintuitive for the user.

In researching all of this, I've found what appear to my naive eye to be a few incongruities in the way the systems currently interplay:
  1.) If a user's session has expired unbeknownst to him / her, there is a bit of a discrepancy in how ""AJAX"" requests are handled in container and non-container authentication models.
     a.) In container-based auth, the AJAX request is sent back a 302 request, which so far I haven't seen percolate up the DOM and successfully (directly) reroute the user, but I can conceive of some browsers allowing for it.  In all cases, the HELPER_DONE_URL is probably mis-set in all cases to the asynchronous request URL vs. somewhere that the user would really want to be.
     b.) In non-container auth, the request is simply returned empty and it is left to the JS to decide upon appropriate behavior (Presence will force reload of the current page).
  2.) If a user's session expires in the background, the asynchronous tools handle the event differently than one another regardless of authentication model
     a.) The Presence tool reloads the current page upon detecting an expired session, leading to that page being the destination upon successful reauthentication.
     b.) OTOH, the timeout system will force the user to go back to the default portal page (usually /portal) when that tool detects session expiration.

IMO, 1 and 2 are separate issues which remain beyond the one above.  2 is straightforward to resolve after an expected-behavior decision is reached; 1 I think is more complicated because of how the container model is essentially behaving as a filter.

In any case, the submitted patch addresses *neither* of these other two issues, but instead eliminates the side-effect problem behavior for container-based authenticators.  [at least in our environment!]

I've probably left something egregious out in the above, so please let me know what else I can address (or learn) and I'll go recaffeinate.

Thanks!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some professors originally had a hard time switching from their static HTML course web sites to a full fledged LMS like Sakai. We found that the best way to get them to make the jump was to provide a way for them to retain the content of their static HTML sites and display it inside of our Sakai system. 

At the same time, its also beneficial to our existing users as they can quickly whip up some web pages for a lesson and push them into the content tool for other users to view.

The option is configured on the Edit Details page of a folder in the content tool. If the folder contains an index page(.html or .htm) the page will open in a new window whenever anyone clicks on that folder in the content tool. If no index page exists, a simple sakai-ized directory listing will be provided to the user. Similar to what you see if you use the web address provided on the same page. 

Screenshot-3 shows the details page for the folder.
Screenshot-1 shows the expanded folder view in the content tool.
Screenshot-2 shows the index.html page that is opened once Display as web page is selected for that folder.

The attached patch is tested and working in Sakai 2.9.1 community source.

"New extension point for customizing selection of user IDs for rendering in URLs, esp. WebDAV URLs",SAK-11110,23673,New Feature,OPEN,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project. Please follow the <a href=""https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/MGT/Sakai+Jira+Guidelines"">Jira Guidelines</a>",http://sakaiproject.org,Minor,,dmccallum,dmccallum,dmccallum,13-Aug-2007 12:29,01-Aug-2017 12:28,18-Feb-2021 03:40,,2.4.x,2.5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Content,User service (Pre-K1/2.6),WebDAV,,,,,0,ContributedPatch,,,,,,,,"This patch amends the User and UserDirectoryService APIs to introduce a new first-class User attribute -- ""urlEmbeddableId"" -- with the specific goal of allowing local customization of user ID selection during DAV URL calculation. By default, this attribute is simply an alias for User.eid. Localized behavior can be implemented by mixing-in the UrlEmbeddableIdAdvisorUDP to a UserDirectoryProvider implementation, similar to the way in which User.displayId and User.displayName access can be localized by implementing DisplayAdvisorUDP.

This patch was motivated by user ID token management issues at Georgia Tech. Specifically, we were trying to cope with WebDAV URLs rendered by the Resources tool UI. These URLs were calculated by concatenating a base URL + ""~"" + User.eid, which probably works perfectly well at most institutions, but which produces markedly ugly URLs at instutions such as Georgia Tech where the User.eid field contains opaque integration IDs. Although this problem could have been solved by simply suffixing DAV URLs with User.displayId rather than User.eid, we opted to introduce a new User attribute since User.displayId access may well have been implemented in the wild to return screen-friendly but not necessarily URL-friendly values. Also, no ""finder"" method exists for locating users by displayId, so some UDS API extension would have been necessary even if we had chosen not to introduce a new User attribute. Note that as currently defined in this patch, User.urlEmbeddableId is not intended to be URL-encoded, only URL-friendly, and no URL-encoding logic has been implemented in the user-impl module. Preferrably, User.urlEmbeddableId access would be coded such that no character escaping would be necessary.

In addition to the User API changes, this patch includes modifications to ResourcesAction and DavServlet code for rendering and resolving   urlEmbeddableId-derived DAV URLs.

The attached patch (""user-url-embeddable-ids--trunk.diff"") targets the pre-2.5 trunk, but I've set the issue's ""Affects Version/s"" to both ""2.4.x"" and ""2.5.0 [Tentative]"" since Georgia Tech is running code very similar to this against a 2.4.x-based source tree.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"13-Aug-2007 12:29;dmccallum;user-url-embeddable-ids--trunk.diff;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/14282/user-url-embeddable-ids--trunk.diff",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10590,,,,,,"0|1034zc:",18306,,,,,Not started,,,,,,,"13-Aug-2007 16:52;clayf;If I understand the preferred convention, it's to have a branch created with this JIRA # and then some discussion.  How should things proceed if the contributor doesn't have committer access to trunk, Ian?","20-Aug-2007 14:51;ianeboston;There are 2 issues here,

1. The patch is quite wide and I think there may be some holes in the logic.... although I haven verified that there are. I am concerned that URLs exposed in this way are not processed correctly by all the various routes to the 'user' urls since not all the routes use the ResourcesAction. One version of the eid might work for Resources but a user might for instance expect the same base url to work for calendar, wiki or an other tool that uses the access servlet. I know we have content at Cambridge where users have made the assumption of relative URL's between tools based on the user site URL. If this is not consistant there is a rather large support load.

2. I would rather no increase the number of methods in the API's prefering to have a new Interface, and have the code test if the target implements the interface. This greatly reduces the load on implementors and some institutions that are starting to have more than one UDP, some EID's may have embeddable versions and some not. the FederatedUDP exists in the core release, and is in use at 2 institutions I know of.

A patch is fine, provided its impact can be controlled in the way above, a brance would certainly be needed if there was to be a level of experimentation.

So if the above can be addressed, then I can apply the patch (in the spirit of giving you a qualified no)

","20-Aug-2007 14:52;ianeboston;Dan,
Please see comments.","09-May-2008 13:36;raydavis;If I'm reading the patch correctly, it looks as though the UserDirectoryService portions actually don't rely on any data that's private to the UserDirectoryService code. If you're game, I think this could let you avoid any changes to existing interfaces:

1. Rather than hiding UrlEmbeddableIdAdvisorUDP inside UDS, expose it as a service with an overrideable default implementation. Inject the UDS into it to do user lookup.
2. Have the couple of clients that need the new capability use the new service rather than the UDS.
","09-May-2008 14:08;dmccallum;Ray,

I completely understand where you're coming from, and your point about the lack of shared data concerns between the UDS and these new methods is a good one. However.... I remember another recent discussion in which it seemed that there had been confusion about which interface a client should invoke when authenticating a user. In that case the wrong (but perfectly reasonable) choice had been made, leading to much cache-related teeth gnashing. The decision that decoupled authN services into two separate interfaces was a valid one, I think: coordinating and executing authN are discrete concerns. But, b/c the distinction is subtle, it left the door open to reasonable mistakes. I think a new interface for ""alternate ID"" retrieval/finders creates a similar opportunity for mistakes or at least head-scratching. If I have UserDirectoryService and User interfaces, which seem to know all about user attributes, and which expose displayId properties which look an awful lot like what I, Joe Tool Developer, am interested in processing, why do I need to remember that for this one special case of ""lookupable alternate displayable IDs"" I need to go look for another interface altogether? Joe will probably eventually figure out that he's not actually interested in displayIds and there's this _other_ way over _here_ to find users by non-eid tokens, but it's my guess that Joe would appreciate having all his user finder methods in one ""place"" such that he has at least somewhat greater chance of figuring out that ""displayId"" might not be exactly what he thinks he needs.

All of this is a round-about way of saying that I _prefer_ the aesthetics of a consolidated API who's business it is to find users, particularly if it can be done in a way that isn't actually disruptive to deployed customizations, which I believe to be limited to UDPs.

I am not immovable on this point though, and my sense is that I am in the minority in general. So, Ray, if you tell me that extending the UDS API is simply not acceptable, fine. I will alter the patch.","09-May-2008 14:30;raydavis;The confusion about authenticating a user was due to what looked like the same method being implemented by multiple services. I see no point in that -- as far as I'm concerned it's an unfortunate bit of history. So now we have a user directory service ""authenticate"" and an authentication service ""authenticate"" and a user directory provider ""authenticate"", and Joe gets the pleasure of deciding which one needs to be called, customized, cached, etc., and we get the pleasure of maintaining them all.

You're basically adding two new methods: ""getUserByUrlEmbeddableId"" and ""getUrlEmbeddableId(user)"". And you can either have them show up in one service or you can have them show up in two services.... I figure you can see where I'm going here.  :)
","09-May-2008 14:33;raydavis;By the way, I don't consider myself the owner of the UDS API. (FWIW, I'd trust you with that responsibility more than I would myself.) I'm just trying to lay out a case for a more hands-off approach.","09-May-2008 16:03;dmccallum;I appreciate your point about method duplication/decentralization. In this particular case, though, (I think) I'm willing to tolerate it for two reasons:

  1) I don't want to fragment the UDS API. I don't think what's going on with this ""alt ID"" would be enough to justify an all-new interface in a green-field system and many people (many == { James R, David H, me, others? }) seem to default to thinking that the UDS is where findUserByX() APIs live. Doesn't necessarily mean they're/I'm right, but I'd rather satisfy these people's implicit assumptions than worry about the maintenance cost to me or the impact to Jokers Who Implemented Their Own UDS.

  2) Although there is not currently a finder method for displayId and there's actually only one XxxAdvisorUDP that I'm aware of, I think the patch's decision to separate the finder from the advice matches people's received understanding of how user APIs split up responsibilities, i.e. finders go on UDS, attribute accessors go on User, localizable attribute accessor overrides go on XxxAdvisorUDP mixins.

So it sounds like we're just down to a good old-fashioned difference of opinion.

I'm not entirely sure of the best path forward, and none of this addresses the ID contextualization issue being discussed in parallel. Perhaps James R will have some feedback that will de-fog things, or perhaps Paris will clear everything up. For now, though, I am _not_ planning to hack on this patch in the immediate future unless new opinions/information emerge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
VelocityPortalRenderEngine ignores custom skin when loading options.config and velocity template files,SAK-13883,27624,New Feature,Awaiting Review,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project.

The code meant to detect custom skin setting checks session attributes and request parameters, but does not check the skin.default value set in sakai.properties.

Also, init() always loads macros.vm from defaultskin path. These macros cannot be redefined by later loading of a custom macros.vm.

The attached file patches VelocityPortalRenderEngine.java to eliminate loading macros.vm during init(), and adds a check of the server configuration for a custom skin in newRenderContext().

If an options.config file is not found on the custom skin path, it falls back to loading the default file from defaultskin. Likewise, if a custom skin does not define a specific velocity template .vm file, the default template is loaded from defaultskin.

Thanks.","19-Nov-2008 16:57;dmccallum;Attaching a slightly revised patch (SAK-13883-pre-27-trunk.diff), this time targeting the pre-2.7 trunk (core).

Biggest differences:

  1) Removes rather than comments out the ""vengine.getTemplate(""/vm/defaultskin/macros.vm"");"" line from VelocityPortalRenderEngine.init().

  2) Adds a check for a configured default skin in the event VelocityPortalRenderEngine.newRenderContext() receives a null HttpServletRequest reference

  3) Extracts checks for configured default skin into a method: getConfiguredSkinOrDefault(). I did this because the same logic is now invoked twice from VelocityPortalRenderEngine.newRenderContext().

Again, this patch tries to address a number of different but related issues having to do with letting sakai.properties-defined default skins define their own markup:

  1) Allow sakai.properties-configured skins to override macros defined in /vm/defaultskin/macros.vm (completely replace that file, actually) -- this is something of a moot point now that the default skin doesn't use that file any longer.
  2) Allow sakai.properties-configured skins to deploy their own portal *.vm files to override defaultskin *.vm files, falling back to the latter in the absence of the former
  3) Allow sakai.properties-configured skins to deploy their own options.config files for controlling certain portal features, e.g. ""include-bottom""

Unfortunately, time constraints have so far prevented me from authoring unit tests to prove the behavior. For a quick functional demo:

  1) Stop sakai
  2) Before applying patch, set ""skin.default = myskin"" in sakai.properties
  3) cp -r webapps/library/skin/default webapps/library/skin/myskin
  4) mkdir webapps/portal-render/vm/myskin/
  5) cp webapps/portal-render/vm/defaultskin/site.vm webapps/portal-render/vm/myskin/
  6) edit webapps/portal-render/vm/myskin/site.vm to output some custom content
  7) Hit the gateway site. Custom content will _not_ appear.

Enable or disable menu items in Worksite Setup and Site Info tools,SAK-14462,28734,New Feature,Awaiting Review,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project. Please follow the <a href=""https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/MGT/Sakai+Jira+Guidelines"">Jira Guidelines</a>",http://sakaiproject.org,Minor,,,bsawert,bsawert,17-Sep-2008 16:03,01-Aug-2017 12:28,18-Feb-2021 03:40,,2.5.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Site Info,Sites (Admin) Tool,,,,,,1,ContributedPatch,,,,,,,,"This patch modifies the site-manage-tool module to permit configuration of menu items on Worksite Setup and Site Info tools by specifying comma-delimited lists of Spring-style patterns to be matched against these menu items' ""actions"". ""Sprint-style"" patterns means you can use shell-like wildcards (e.g. ""*xxx*""). Excludes override includes. Neither field is required. Neither field overrides other menu item business rules already present in Sakai. An empty site.setup.menu.entry.excludes means ""don't exclude anything."" An empty site.setup.menu.entry.includes means ""include anything."" 

In some other cases, certain non-configurable business rules control the presence or absence of some menu item. You cannot use the new configuration options to cause menu options to appear which would have otherwise been suppressed by these business rules. For example, causing site.setup.menu.entry.includes to match ""doNew_site"" will not cause the corresponding menu item to appear for under-privileged users.

There are several menu item actions, though, whose presence was already controllable from configuration:

  doMenu_group -- configured by wsetup.group.support
  doAttachmentsMtrlFrmFile -- configured by site.setup.import.file
  doPageOrderHelper -- configured by sakai-site-pageorder-helper's hidden/stealthed status

Such pre-existing configuration is treated just like the business rules described above. In all cases these pre-existing settings override our _includes_ configuration, but our new _excludes_ configuration overrides of these pre-existing settings. So, for example, if wsetup.group.support is true, but site.setup.menu.entry.excludes matches ""doMenu_group"", the Site Info menu will _not_ include a group management option. Contrariwise, even if site.setup.menu.entry.includes matches ""doMenu_group"", the group management option will not appear if wsetup.group.support is false.

Here is the list of known menu entry actions configurable with these new properties:

doAttachmentsMtrlFrmFile
doGet_site
doGroup_new
doMenu_add_class_section
doMenu_edit_site_access
doMenu_edit_site_info
doMenu_edit_site_tools
doMenu_group
doMenu_site_delete
doMenu_siteInfo_addClass
doMenu_siteInfo_addParticipant
doMenu_siteInfo_duplicate
doMenu_siteInfo_editClass
doMenu_siteInfo_import
doNew_site
doPageOrderHelper

Finally, please note that while the code changes support include/exclude of the ""doSearch"" menu item action, it appears that this code is actually dead. Inclusiuon/exclusion has no effect on the UI. 

The attached diff file patches SiteAction.java and pom.xml and creates two new classes, StringMatcher.java and SpringPatternStringMatcher.java.

  SAK-14462-pre-27-trunk.diff -- Updates changes to SiteAction to work against a recent checkout of the pre-2.7 trunk. Moves StringMatcher and SpringPatternStringMatcher into the org.sakaiproject.site.util package. Also includes unit tests for the new functionality (SiteActionTest, SpringPatternStringMatcherTest).

  SAK-14464-SAK-14462-SiteActionTest.diff -- Just the differences in SiteActionTest between SAK-14464 and SAK-14462. So if you were accept the pre-2.7 trunk patch from SAK-14464 first, this patch should hopefully make it easier to deal with overlapping changes in the SiteActionTest class.

A few other notes:

  1) I did spend some time rethinking whether there was a better way to pull off the trick of suppressing any given WS Setup/Site Info menu items. This patch solved a local problem nicely, but certainly adds potential configuration complexity for those menu items which were already suppressible by other means. Adding more one-off properties didn't seem any better, though. Nor did switching to using resource bundle keys to identify menu items since many of those keys are so generic, e.g.  ""java.new"" and ""java.revise"". So I pressed on with the StringMatcher approach using menu action keys as identifiers.

  2) Here is an updated list of menu action keys:

  Keys without other suppression controls (other than permissions/site type):

    doNew_site
    doGet_site
    doMenu_site_delete
    doMenu_edit_site_info
    doMenu_edit_site_tools
    doMenu_edit_site_access
    doMenu_siteInfo_duplicate
    doMenu_siteInfo_import -- although can be replaced by doMenu_siteInfo_importSelection by setting clean.import.site
    doMenu_siteInfo_addClass

  Keys with other suppression controls (other than permissions/site type):

    doPageOrderHelper -- controlled by stealthing/hiding and hide.pageorder.site.types
    doParticipantHelper -- controlled by stealthing/hiding
    doMenu_siteInfo_editClass -- controlled by site.setup.allow.editRoster (and must be a course type)
    doManageGroupHelper -- controlled by stealthing/hiding and wsetup.group.support
    doMenu_siteInfo_importSelection"" -- controlled by ""clean.import.site"" (if not set will always show doMenu_siteInfo_import)
    doAttachmentsMtrlFrmFile -- controlled by site.setup.import.file

  3) There were two semi-significant changes to the way the patch works:

    3.1) It defines addSearchMenusIfEnabled() rather than overriding addSearchMenus() since we didn't actually need to worry about external call sites with dependencies on SiteAction.addSearchMenus()

    3.2) It tries to preserves the logic for choosing between doMenu_siteInfo_importSelection and doMenu_siteInfo_import such that the latter will still be considered if clean.import.site is true but doMenu_siteInfo_importSelection has been excluded by configuration. I am unsure if this is the best behavior or if it is better to automatically skip consideration of doMenu_siteInfo_import in these cases.","21-Nov-2008 15:17;dmccallum;SAK-14464-SAK-14462-SiteActionTest.diff did not work well.

2) AuthzGroupService.getAuthzGroupsForSiteType(String) -- Finds AuthzGroups associated with Sites of the given type.

preview images for template selection in worksite setup,SAK-23865,59855,New Feature,Awaiting Review,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project.

I'm told others are interested in this feature, so I've been asked to contribute it back.

I implemented this feature by adding a new span and some javascript to the Worksite Setup screen where a user chooses a template. For each available template, there is an image with the css 'display:none', so nothing is visible by default. The images are expected to be named <template-site-id>.png (example: 878b9b8a-c4e3-4729-b516-8750b0bb7dd8.png). When a template is selected in the dropdown, the corresponding image is set to display (and all others are set back to 'none', thus hiding them). I initially tried triggering on mouse in/out so that the preview image switched based on what the user was hovering over, but this caused noticeable slowness in Firefox so we elected instead to trigger on the select onChange. If there is no image at the specified path, nothing is displayed.

You'll likely need/want to adjust the new css from this patch to suit your own skin. The attached patch file was generated against a vanilla 2.9.1 checkout of site-manage, and seems to work fine (the development was done using our own 2.9.x copy of site-manage). You can modify the image positioning and/or size to fit your needs.

This change makes use of a new sakai property,
   siteManage.template.previewImagePath
to allow you to store the images where you like. At UVa, we use a path configured in our apache to allow our support staff to add/remove content without having to go through developers and/or subversion:
   siteManage.template.previewImagePath=/docs/images/template-preview   

However, you could easily configure it to point to a path within the reference project (where most skin stuff and images are stored) like so:
   siteManage.template.previewImagePath=/library/skin/<your skin>/<your desired path>
   siteManage.template.previewImagePath=/library/image/<your desired path>
   
We use the template images to show the toolsets a user will get by using the selected template, rather than a full 'screenshot' of sakai a sakai page. See attached image as an example.

So here's what you need to do to just simply try this out as-is:
* apply the patch & build site-manage
* add siteManage.template.previewImagePath=<your_desired_image_location> to sakai.properties
* add PNG images (named <template-site-id>.png, size 320 px w X 420 px h or smaller) to directory configured in previous step (and build, if path is in the reference project)
* restart sakai and select a template in worksite setup to see the preview image",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"19-Aug-2013 10:55;kcarruth;basic-course.png;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/37144/basic-course.png","19-Aug-2013 10:55;kcarruth;template-preview.patch;https://jira.sakaiproject.org/secure/attachment/37143/template-preview.patch",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20185,,,,,,"0|106l5s:",38423,,,,,Not started,,,,,,,"20-Aug-2013 07:45;gsilver;Kevin,

The template picking UI has been thoroughly redone of late. Can you examine the current state (in Sakai Nightly trunk, for example) and see if there is overlap with this feature, is the feature no longer needed given the new UI, or does the feature add value? And maybe recreate the patch against trunk if that is not too much hassle? This way UVa will inherit the change via upgrades and no longer have to patch site-manage for it.

Marking this as a feature request, but it came up in the discussion on list an on SAK-31587 that it would be nice if portal chat was extended from a standard jquery widget. Probably something like ui-dialog like this example

maybe with some extra buttons

The banner bar can be customised using these properties:

* ‘backgroundColour’ – the colour of main banner (specified as #rrggbb colour, for example, #f133e6). 

* ‘backgroundImage’ – the URL of the background image of the main banner (will tile)

* ‘imageSource’ – the URL of a single image at the right end of the main banner (can be blank). For the moment, this should be of the appropriate size and if you want more than one image then it is your responsibility to construct a composite. Images are always displayed full-sized.

* ‘imageLink’ – the URL of a website that the image at the right end of the banner will link to

* ‘message’ – that that overrides ‘site title’ and will be displayed in the grey bar (2nd bar down on the page underneath the 'black bar' - it contains any subsite hierarchy plus the current ""site title > current tool""). Can remain unset in which case the current site title will be used (default behaviour)

* ‘fontColour’ – the colour of the font of the ‘message’ (specified as #rrggbb colour) -ie, the colour of the text: ""site title > current tool""

On the mobile view the height of the navigation bar will be fixed and RHS Images ('imageSource') won't be shown. By implication, there will be no link to the URL specified in the ""imageLink""

If you enable the feature you can set global default values for each property on the sakai.properties file and then override them for any site you want using site properties.

Morpheus provides an easy way to customize your skin, changing colours, fonts, sizes, and lots of things. If you find other stuff that you want to customize and you didn't find the variable to do it in morpheus, please feel free to add the variables you need in morpheus scss files.","02-Aug-2016 02:30;eduardorey;As Juanjo has said, I think we should maintain separated CSS from HTML (Velocity). Finally Sakai have achieved this goal and now a designer can make their own skin without having to know if there is a chance of anything could add CSS by its own.

I think we can improve morpheus in many many ways but this is not a way to move on on this.","02-Aug-2016 04:22;adamm;What we are talking about here is customising the second bar down the page (the graduated grey-coloured bar)

I agree that the functionality to change the default look throughout a whole instance is covered by Morpheus, however, the main thrust of this code is to customise individual sites. 

One needs to get an admin user to set the site properties in the Sites tool although we plan to add the UI for site owners to be able to do this in Site Info. This would allow site owners to customise their sites and it removes the need for a ""Site Image Icon"" which doesnt work too well with Morpheus.

The other way this can (potentially) be used is to change the look of all sites which have access delegated to a particular department. (I'm not too sure how delegated access works but we have a similar scheme at Oxford: for a given department, we set the banner plus image linking to a departmental website and the look and feel cascades down to all sites whose management has been delegated. This can give individual departments their own branded look. 

It would also be a boon if one instance Sakai is being collectively used by different institutions - each can have their own logo and so forth.

","02-Aug-2016 04:46;jjmerono@um.es;It doesn't matter wich part of the look&feel you want to customize is how you want to do it. I think the best way to do it this is just using the current site property that define the skin of the site. Of course you need a way to let the user generate a skin or modify it without css skills, but this is other topic, if the user is able to generate and deploy ""department-skin"" into Sakai he can use it just using the skin property (and he could change everything).

IMHO the best way to do this would be adding a skin/theme manager like this: https://github.com/EdiaEducationTechnology/edia-sakai-skinmanager
Adding properties to the site to modify certain parts is a short term solution, and probably not useful for all, because someone could want to change other parts. The long term solution would be add a skin manager that let admins to import skins and even modify them using the tool. Also we need to evolve morpheus to deal together with css and templates to create themes (a real customization) instead of skins.

I know this could take a lot of time but let me dream on it :)
","02-Aug-2016 04:53;adamm;The reason we added this really simple code is because the Edia skin manager is so heavyweight and not really maintained.

To make it more granular, we could also have a way to add time frames with an associated penalty. To do so, all we would need is a time picker and a ""Add another"" icon at the end of the line.

What do you think?","12-Nov-2009 12:23;zqian;Thanks for the screenshot. I will use it as a start for discussion here with User experts.
","13-Nov-2009 07:24;mathieu;I added another wireframe to explain what in instructor should see when grading (image 5). The instructor could see the effect of the penalty, grade as if the work had been submitted in time, and see the final grade that would be released to the student. The instructor could also decide to ignore the penalty effect and grade the work for what it is.","16-Dec-2009 07:16;adevans;Matt, given your wireframes and such it looks as though there would be an overall deduction/penalty subtracted from the regular grade score, but my faculty have asked for something that is more like what Zhen first commented on: to be able to give a regular grade, but then the system automatically deducts 1 point (or 1/3 letter grade) per late day.  See my attachment for info.","16-Dec-2009 08:30;mathieu;Hi Amber,

I described the most basic scenario in my wireframes. Your new attachment makes a lot of sense. In fact, I'd rather have a very fine grained deduction strategy with time intervals and associated penalties and stuff, but I think it would be overkill. But there is probably a way to integrate your request and still keep the user interface clean. 

Why would we make ""days"" be our only lateness currency? Would the day lateness apply automatically at 12:01 a.m. or at the time of the original due date?

Anyway, that's why I try to create wireframes as much as possible, so that they can be deconstructed, adjusted, made better. So thanks for sharing your concerns here!","22-Sep-2015 15:14;mjb5hd;We've had some requests for this feature at UVa, so I've added a TL tag to this jira so that it can be discussed in an upcoming ""jira of the week.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Add possibility for admin to close other users' session,SAK-28030,64030,New Feature,Awaiting Review,SAK,Sakai,software,maintenanceteam,"The core Sakai Project.

- A user starts editing something (another user, an announcement, etc.), then disappears without closing the session. You won't be able to enter that screen until the session ends after the timeout and unblocks it.

- Admins may just want to kick some user (or every user) out of the system at a certain moment. Could be useful for testing in develop instances, maybe even for security reasons.

Obviously it should be approached carefully and used with responsability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9223372036854775807,,,,,,"0|108f5c:",9223372036854775807,,,,,Not started,,,,,,,"22-Apr-2015 08:30;jonespm;Sounds like a nice request especially if it was added to the UI in the Online (presence) tool but that doesn't look like it exists yet. 

The code for logout in UsageSessionServiceAdaptor is

	public void logout()
	{
		userDirectoryService().destroyAuthentication();

		securityService.clearUserEffectiveRoles();
		
		// invalidate the sakai session, which makes it unavailable, unbinds all the bound objects,
		// including the session, which will close and generate the logout event
		Session sakaiSession = sessionManager().getCurrentSession();
		sakaiSession.invalidate();
	}

I think you'd minimally want to run
Session session = sessionManager().getSession(sessionId)
session.invalidate()

You'd probably need to look through the SessionManager to find which sessions are associated with which user id if you wanted to close a specific session. Seems like a little work but could be a useful feature. Though the user could just log back in again, as this doesn't lock their account. (That would be separate : KNL-994)

2) If one changes something for a past assignment (e.g. for a late submit), then there is a warning at the top of the page, saying ""to confirm, re-click the post button"", which is all the way at the bottom of the page and requires scrolling down to confirm. It would be nice to have a ""confirm"" button with the re-confirm message at the top.

3) On the assignments list page, it shows two of the dates for each entry, open and due, but now the other two dates (accept until, resubmit until). Is there any simple way to get a complete list of the assignment specs. And dates? Right now it seems like one would have to click into each and do some manual copying and collecting of information. It would be nice to be able to get a list of this information for all assignments in a course.

121071,OPEN,Integrated terminal becomes very laggy on Ubuntu via remote ssh,,2021-04-12 06:59:54 +0000 UTC,renkun-ken,,"
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4662568/114352681-b80e1200-9b9e-11eb-834b-5c4d0c622dcc.png)

To narrow down the problem, I tried the following:

1. Locally, printing the table is very fast.
2. In a local vscode, open the integrated terminal and ssh to the server and start R, and print `mtcars`. It is very fast too.
3. Use remote ssh to connect to the server. Open the integrated terminal and start R and print `mtcars`. It is very laggy, i.e. the printing is almost done line by line.

The typing in the integrated terminal is laggy too. In current release (1.55.1), I need to switch to `""terminal.integrated.rendererType"": ""canvas""` so that typing is no longer laggy. In current insider, the setting is gone, and I have to use `""terminal.integrated.gpuAcceleration"": ""off""` and the laggy typing is fixed. However, in both cases, while the laggy typing is fixed, the laggy printing via remote ssh still persists.

1. Be in any view other than Search (optional, but adds evidence about the problem later).
2. Open a file.
3. Open a peek (e.g. peek a definition).
4. Select some text in the peek.
5. Enter `Ctrl+Shift+F`

:bug: the selected text does not transfer into the Search field, though the Search view appears and focus moves to that field.

121059,OPEN,A project that I have developed with PHP and HTML Combined; all HTML tags are white; before I colored well the html code together with the php,new release,2021-04-11 20:07:41 +0000 UTC,jeansjave,,"
Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

Please describe the issue in 2-3 sentences. Include what you're trying to accomplish when the issue occurs.
Simply when I have PHP and HTML code combined, all the HTML tags turn white and if I change the theme, the white color persists and it does not color well.

When did it begin and how often does it occur?
Started 2 weeks ago

What errors do you see?
You do not see any error, it is only at the visualization level, I mostly occupy the topic ""ayu dark"", and I can't get the html tags to color, but if I open an .html file if the tags are colored well, just It happens to me when it recognizes that it is a .php file, and the htm codes are all blank and that is confusing.

What's the environment and are there recent changes?
I have tried to change the theme but nothing always shows the HTML tags in white color, being that it is a .php file

OS: Darwin x64 19.6.0

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Install ms-azuretools.vscode-docker 1.11.0 (newer versions will fix this specific flavor which means you'd have to find your own language server alert)
2. Create a Dockerfile with the content from https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/blob/ce3aff0bfdf1cbabeffecb5afc28cf6b1c719e25/Dockerfile#L17-L22
3. Hover over the squiggly line
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2119212/114314354-419ee080-9ac8-11eb-9a56-0022beac0d13.png)
4. Click `View Problem`
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2119212/114314346-377ce200-9ac8-11eb-9873-7535dd0cdb86.png)
5. It isn't readily apparent what `(34)` is or why there's no space between it and `dockerfile-utils`.

I suppose I should define `is`. Both views already tell me what the warning is. They do not explain why they also show `(34)`. Letting one hover over this or click to see a hint indicating that this is a language-server specific identifier for this warning category would be quite elucidating.

For instance, can I use the `(34)` to ignore the alert? I have no idea. Maybe I can, but only for certain language servers? These views are a good way to teach me what I can do w/ the content they're presenting.

Also, while you're in the area, if there was a way to cause `dockerfile-utils` to explain which extension(s) contributed it, that'd be really helpful. I eventually figured out that I wanted to file a bug against microsoft/vscode-docker, but it wasn't remotely obvious.

Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes/No
No (well, you need a language server, and I don't know if vscode has any built in)

<!-- 📣 Issues caused by an extension need to be reported directly to the extension publisher. The 'Help > Report Issue' dialog can assist with this. -->
This bug isn't about the language server (I already filed microsoft/vscode-docker#2865 about their contribution), it's about vscode's rendering of the report from the language server:
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/2865#issuecomment-817340146

Fwiw, I currently use the reporter format for my GitHub Action, and at some point, I might look into making it available as a vscode extension, since I'm starting to live here, as do my colleagues.

GitHub Actions, afaict, do not render the identifier:

121050,OPEN,New line after the equals sign for function assignment loses syntax highlighting,,2021-04-11 14:10:39 +0000 UTC,qdirks,,"Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

Steps to reproduce:
Open a new tab (double click in the tab area) and use javascript syntax highlighting (ctrl+k, m javascript enter). Paste the code segment below into the tab. Syntax highlighting is not good. The assignments to the variables after a new line regain highlighting after saving the file. The assignments to the object members after a new line will remain unhighlighted even after saving the file.

```
let fn1 = ()=>{};
let fn2 =
    ()=>{};
let fn3 = function() {};
let fn4 =
    function() {};

let obj = {};
obj.fn0 = ()=>{};
obj.fn1 =
    ()=>{};
obj.fn2 = function() {};
obj.fn3 =
    function() {};
```

Expected behavior:
The syntax highlighting should always be present, after a new line, and also before saving.

This is an issue about the WebView API.

Create a WebView and use the following HTML content:

``` html
<html>
 <head>
  <base href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"" target=""_blank"">
 </head>
 <body>
  <a href=""/wiki/a#a"">click here</a>

But the browser cannot be opened after this link is clicked. As a test,

I tried several different styles:

``` html

Only `/wiki/a#a` does not work. All others can open the browser normally and jump to the target webpage. Strangely enough, this link does not seem to be a problem when viewed in DEBUG mode:

1. Switch from the .py file to the Python Interactive window using only the keyboard. 
2. Scroll up using the keyboard to view the output of `df.head()`.
3. Switch back to the .py file and write more code, using only the keyboard.

There doesn't seem to be any way to do this. I can switch to the Python Interactive window using `Ctrl + 2`, but it goes to the console input, and I can't scroll the previous outputs. 

Avoiding use of the mouse for scrolling and switching windows is a very important accessibility issue for me. At present I find VS Code almost unusable for interactive analysis because of lack of support for keyboard-only workflows.

6. Try `code . --help`
7. Realize you can't even view the view available options because you can't start it without updating.
8. Realize you can't google how to start it because the internet is disconnected.

This is 100% unambiguously a bug. I'm aware it's possible to disable this behavior within VS Code. The user needs to be able to disable this on the command line, and the user needs to be able to view the help on the command line whether or not the internet is available.

I find that I often need to do such swaps when writing mathematical papers in Latex. There I'd make a first choice for symbols, but later decide that the symbols are better named the other way around.

**I would like to ask if we could add desktop.ini (and maybe thumbs.db as well) to this default list?**

desktop.ini files are created by the Windows Explorer when you customize a directory (for example adding a custom icon). For details please refer to [How to Customize Folders with Desktop.ini](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/how-to-customize-folders-with-desktop-ini).

This file is imho a counterpart to the already added .DS_Store used on macOS. 
> In the Apple macOS operating system, .DS_Store is a file that stores custom attributes of its containing folder, such as the position of icons or the choice of a background image.

121004,OPEN,Code formatting (es6) broken. Messes code up,,2021-04-10 10:07:40 +0000 UTC,bencresty,,"
The reason for this 'confused formatter' seems to be that after copying code with jsdoc, the alignment of the method name is wrong in the pasted fragment and that confuses the formatter for the rest of the code and every time it tries to format it after that paste. BTW in the example below the error-offset is only one space, but it also happens that the alignment skips 'tabs' (spaces here) and that makes the code even more misaligned and so unreadable and messed up.

See gif:

![Formatter-Issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69322733/114264983-78a0c380-99ee-11eb-9106-122960254235.gif)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Copy code with jsdoc
2. Paste code with jsdoc
3. See that the method name isn't alligned as supposed to, but now is aligned to the jsDoc. See that the formatter is confused and keeps messing up.

My eyesight isn't as good as it was when I was young, hopefully it's not just my old eyes.

I tested a couple of different pre-installed color themes and the problem could be found in all of them.

I tried to fix it by adding custom colors to settings.json as shown below. Tested by me were two different file types, JSON and PS1 (PowerShell), it was working in JSON but in PS1 which is more important to me, my customization did not work no matter what I tried.

I have added more logging since 1.54.1, so if you could try with [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) I will get a bit more information. If not, there are still useful logs in 1.54.1.

1. Connect to your remote.
2. Run the command ""Developer: Set Log Level..."" and choose ""Trace""
3. Try to forward the port as you say.
4. Open the ""Output"" view. You can use the command ""Output: Focus on Output View"".
5. The output view has a dropdown. Please share the output from the following log sources:
 - Log (Window)
 - Log (Extension Host)
 - Log (Remote Extension Host). 

> In order to resolve the EADDRINUSE issue I just manually killed the port so that I can run my node js application. Now my terminal is able to run my app and I got a message Express server listening on port 8000.

Maybe you had a left over process running from a previous time that you ran your application? The terminal is just a terminal, so if you get an error when running that command then it isn't coming from VS Code.

## Repro Steps

1. Start with a standard hello world extension
2. Add this code to the default ""Hello World"" command
    ```typescript
    await vscode.window.showQuickPick(['$(squirrel) hello', '$(squirrel)$(squirrel)$(squirrel) hello'], {
        ignoreFocusOut: true,
        placeHolder: 'Hello world'
    });
    ```
3. F5 the extension
4. Turn on VoiceOver for Mac
5. Run the ""Hello World"" command
6. Move keyboard focus to the first quick pick entry

## Expected

It reads ""Hello""

## Actual

It reads ""hell""

```
so we end up using synonyms like 'enabled', 'disabled', 'default' which is less than ideal.

Another approach would be to use ""oneOf"" and have the choices be type: boolean and type:string with a single enum value.  This gets the desired effect when editing the JSON directly, but unfortunately, we don't get Settings UI support when we try that.

Could we get a new type for configurations, or maybe some kind of UI support for tri-state bools? We'd be fine with whatever syntax would be required for package.json.

I'm wondering whether 1) we should add some margin around the border, 2) experiment with a broader border.

Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

Say we have 4 items in a list view, the viewport can only render 3 complete item and the 4th one is partially visible. The height of the 4th item is taller than the render height (or visual viewport). Now focus the 3rd item and then arrow down. The list view will scroll the bottom of the 4th cell into view so the top half of the 4th item is not visible. I wonder we should try the best to make sure the top of cell is visible when users pressing `arrow down`.

It looks like running that command palette operation mentioned above adds a symlink to the /usr/local/bin directory, which is what I would expect it to do. However, the target of the symlink is a bit odd. I just checked and I see the following in /usr/local/bin:

code -> /private/var/folders/mt/fmkgwzfj1kvg8s105b7znrfh0000gn/T/AppTranslocation/A37EC2BC-124B-4A46-A943-464286617262/d/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin/code

Once rebooting, it looks like the symlink target is no longer a valid path. In my case, when I rebooted, the path segment after AppTranslocation changed to a different UUID, but the rest of the PATH looked correct.

A workaround for now was for me to manually add the following entry to my PATH env var: /Applications/Visual\ Studio\ Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin which of course persists over a reboot, as it is a direct link to where the application lives.

Hi, 

In this screenshot you can easily see my problem. Links lines are too big compared to content.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17770809/114231663-03e07180-997b-11eb-824b-5ed0333a9f36.png)


It would be great that we can simply have an option **to disable those file links**. As you can guess they are useless to me because they always point out to the logger file, which I think is the case of many developers too.

   ```

Now, I can't actually reproduce this on my local machine, and judging by the lack of other reports it seems no one else can either. However this has been reproducibly happening in our CI infrastructure (which is behind a corporate proxy etc.) 🤷‍♀️

The root cause is two yarn.lock entries that resolve to `https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/` rather than `https://registry.yarnpkg.com/`, which seems like an oversight that should be corrected anyway. See #120970 for details and fix.

Currently you can trigger a context menu on the editor by holding a click.
However you can not trigger a context menu anywhere else in the workbench.

@rebornix is there something special that we do for this in the editor?

    public static function methodB() : string

120953,OPEN,git.autorefresh user setting being overridden by default workspace setting,new release,2021-04-10 17:03:34 +0000 UTC,bdharrington7,,"
Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

This started happening on a recent update of VSCode, where git autofetch was triggering (I get prompted for credentials on every check), despite the git.autorefresh setting being disabled in User settings. When I view the workspace settings, git.autofetch is enabled (by default), so when I disable it, the `.vscode/settings.json` file is modified with the key `git.autorefresh: false`

If the User setting is set, and the workspace setting is *not* set (even if the default is ""enabled""), shouldn't the feature be disabled unless the feature is explicitly enabled in the workspace settings (I understand workspace settings override user settings)?

120943,OPEN,iPad: read mode should be the default,feature-request; ios,2021-04-09 18:00:12 +0000 UTC,isidorn,,"iPad, safari or Chrome

As soon as you tap on the editor and focus is moved into the editor the keyboard is shown below thus reducing screen real estate.
I believe that the best experience for an iPad would be that the keyboard appearing would be a much more explicit gesture.
This is because I also believe that most of the iPad use case is code reading, not actually code writing.

I think we could tackle this by:
* Make all editors readonly by default on ipad, and there is a specific user action to make them read write
* Be more careful when automatically pasing focus to the editor, and try to not do this at all on an iPad

Or if there are other tricks for this? I do not think a web page can disable a on screen keyboard.

- V8: 8.7.220.31-electron.0
- OS: Windows_NT x64 10.0.19042

Steps to Reproduce:

Use VS Code in WSL. I cannot reproduce the issue when I reopen the same project window under [Windows.](url
[tasks-issue.zip](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/files/6284717/tasks-issue.zip)
)

You can find the sample project structure attached and skip steps 1-4

1. Create the project structure

```
mkdir tasks-issue && cd tasks-issue
mkdir subfolder
npm init --yes
cd subfolder
npm init --yes
```

2. Open `/package.json` and replace the echo script with this
```
    ""test"": ""echo \""NPM script from root\"" && exit 1""
```
3. Open `/subfolder/package.json'  and change the echo text from the test script to indicate this echo comes from the subfolder package script
```
    ""test"": ""echo \""NPM script from subfolder\"" && exit 1""
```
4. Create a .vscode/tasks.json with the following contents

```json
{
  // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
  // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
  ""version"": ""2.0.0"",
  ""tasks"": [
    {
      ""label"": ""Start root"",
      ""type"": ""npm"",
      ""script"": ""test"",
      ""presentation"": {
        ""reveal"": ""always"",
        ""panel"": ""new"",
        ""group"": ""ensemble""
      }
    },
    {
      ""label"": ""Start subfolder"",
      ""type"": ""npm"",
      ""script"": ""test"",
      ""path"": ""dummy"", //uncomment path to 'fix' the issue
      ""options"": {
        ""cwd"": ""${workspaceFolder}/subfolder""
      },
      ""presentation"": {
        ""reveal"": ""always"",
        ""panel"": ""new"",
        ""group"": ""ensemble""
      }
    },
    {
      ""label"": ""Run Both"",
      ""dependsOn"": [""Start root"", ""Start subfolder""],
      ""group"": ""test""
    }
  ]
}

```
5. Use global menu and select ""Run Task""

Observations:
1. Task ""Start subfolder"" is missing
2. Run task ""Run Both"" and notice that it only executes ""Start root""
3. Uncomment line 20 in tasks.json and notice that both issues from the observations 1 and 2 are gone

- [ ] Left pane needs a higher minimum width, or a better overflow behavior. You can even remove the left padding from each row, to get more space there.
- [ ] Growing/shrinking the splitview should not use the proportional resizing. We should use [different layout priorities](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/e1f0f8f51390dea5df9096718fb6b647ed5a9534/src/vs/base/browser/ui/splitview/splitview.ts#L40-L47) to make sure the left pane doesn't shrink when the entire workbench shrinks, unless absolutely necessary, similar to the workbench sidebar.
- [ ] We should probably use the new [`selectionNavigation`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/e1f0f8f51390dea5df9096718fb6b647ed5a9534/src/vs/platform/list/browser/listService.ts#L196-L196) setting to prevent focus from being different from selection

It is showing two rendered Jupyter notebooks side-by-side with no indication of what has changed.
I also tried enabling / disabling the ""enhanced diff"".

Expected: Being able to use simple JSON file diff

That seems to be possible by disabling the `Jupyter` extension. Unfortunately that also requires disabling the `Python` extension (as `Python` has a dependency on `Jupyter`).
(Previously I was still able to use the JSON diff while using the `Python` extension)

1. there is two command that creating terminal. one is without profile, the new one is  with profile
2. when in multiroot, the frist one give the choice of root,but no choice of profile
3. but the new one have no choice of root but profile

The past couple releases have significantly decreased the speed at which git updates.

Opening changes takes at least 10 seconds, and line highlights for diffs take about 5 seconds to show up. Staging/unstaging/committing all also take much longer than typical.

Disabling all extensions makes no difference in this performance. Command-line git behaves normally.

120882,OPEN,Copy/Paste a file in explorer window has recently broken the editor file focus,file-explorer; under-discussion,2021-04-12 02:07:44 +0000 UTC,klueless-io,,"Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

When  I clone a file, the focus for the file has always been the cloned file and so I can start editing that file and straight away.

This behaviour has changed in the last couple of weeks, I have nearly lost valuable code multiple times recently because of this behaviour change and had thought I was doing something wrong, but I have reproduction steps listed below.

I have tested this without extensions turned on `code --disable-extensions` to rule out issues there.

The following keystrokes (on mac) is a flow that I have been using for years to work on the next (new) class or file in vscode, this flow has recently stopped working as expected.

I have a file opened, I'll call it `original.rb` and it is finished and I am ready to move onto my next class/file.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2956762/114111841-5475b180-991e-11eb-80f2-90e47d010c66.png)


Here are the keystrokes and mouse clicks that I do.

### Clone the current `original.rb` file
  
```
Command+S        - This saves the file 'original.rb'
Command+Shift+E  - This selects the explorer window
Command+C        - This copies the current file 'original.rb'
Command+V.       - This pastes the current file to 'original copy.rb'
```

At this point, the focus in the explorer window is the cloned file 'original copy.rb'  and up until recently the focus in the editor has also been the cloned file 'original copy.rb'

```
I now click mouse in the open editor window
Start editing the new file
```

BUG: This is not the case any more, the original file has the focus in the editor, even though the cloned file has focus in the explorer .
  
What has happened time-after-time in the last week or two is that I click into the editor with the assumption that I am working on the cloned file, I update it, delete irrelevant methods,  add new methods, save my code and then go to run and my build is failing because I was not  altering the cloned file, instead I have been destroying the original file.

### AutoReveal Settings

I've checked the autoReveal settings to see if there was an issue there, but I can't see any issues.

## Environment data

-   VS Code version: 1.56.0-insider
-   Jupyter Extension version (available under the Extensions sidebar): v2021.6.718745073
-   Python Extension version (available under the Extensions sidebar): v2021.3.680753044
-   OS (Windows | Mac | Linux distro) and version: Ubuntu on Windows (WSL2)
-   Python and/or Anaconda version: 3.8.5 64-bit
-   Type of virtual environment used (N/A | venv | virtualenv | conda | ...): venv
-   Jupyter server running: Local

## Expected behaviour

File opens in Notebook Editor when double-clicked

## Actual behaviour

Nothing happens, no error or anything.

## Steps to reproduce:

1. Touch test.ipynb
2. Type something in cell.
3. Save
4. Open as a JSON
5. add a character somewhere to break the file.
6. Try opening it in Notebook editor. Doesn't work (this is expected).
7. Delete the file and touch test.ipynb again
8. Try opening in Notebook editor. Doesn't work. (it's a new file so this is unexpected)
9. Rename the file to test1.ipynb. It works!
10. Filename test.ipynb can never be used again.

Is there a cache that needs to be cleared somewhere? Clearing editor history doesn't work.

Thanks for the issue and your detailed steps @pyg. I can also reproduce it.

Another way to fix it is to reload the window.

This works, thanks! I wasn't even aware that reloading window is different from closing / opening (which I think didn't work). I'll leave the bug open for now in case someone wants to fix, but feel free to close if not.

Right now arrow down will reveal the bottom of the next cell into view, which is annoying as we can't easily navigate and then edit a cell as the editor might be out of view when the cell has a large output

 I have been trying everything under the sun that I can find in order to accomplish this, but have yet to find anything that works. I have been looking for a way to invoke extension functions / internal calls (basically anything you can currently run through the command palette) in a headless manner for use with automated setup and build processes. Similar to how you can run `code --install-extension ext.name.here` but expanded to allow for once an extension is installed, to be able to invoke one of the extensions commands directly using the same text string that would be used to run it from the command palette or when creating a new hotkey. An example being `code --run-command extensionname.extensioncommand` or `code --run-command task.taskname`, etc.

 want have a multi container app ( db, python, react).
I want to run it locally in docker, and connect to the python as well as to the react container. 
The last obstacle is the automatically generated ""compose project name"" which is different.

Following the documentation i created a .env file to create a name for docker compose.
otherwise the 2nd. open folder in container would fire up a complete new compose stack.

Unfortunately when i follow this documentation, i had to create copy of .env file  in the folder wich i opened with the 2nd windows in the container. Probably because then the subfolder is then considered as project root.

2 stars doesn't seem like a good rating. But I installed it anyway. (Yes, it has 3+ stars, but ...)

Keep in mind that a user, like me, won't necessarily know how non present stars work. Sure, it's possible that they're painted as hollow (as VSCode does), but it's also possible that they're painted as invisible, and if a user doesn't see them, and hasn't looked for extensions in general / recently, there's no way for them to know.

stars aren't shown in this view, so there's no hint about how to expect them above:

120810,OPEN,Terminal buffer doesn't span full width,,2021-04-11 15:07:08 +0000 UTC,oliversalzburg,,"
Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

When VS Code opens, the usable buffer of the terminal will be severely truncated in width. Using the terminal beyond the limited width, will result in display corruption:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1658949/114006447-bbcd2c00-9860-11eb-8fe8-aa011590cb61.png)

Closing the terminal and opening it again, restores the buffer to full width. This is very cumbersome, as logging out from the terminal often produces an error message that has to be manually closed as well, before ultimately opening the terminal in its desired state.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1658949/114006654-eb7c3400-9860-11eb-88dd-1690ad39332b.png)

When _restoring_ the window down from maximized state, the terminal buffer fits perfectly into the new bounds of the window. This suggests that this restored window size (or VSCs handling of window state during startup) is also the reason for this glitch.

120807,OPEN,Debugger keeps stepping into skipped files,,2021-04-08 10:07:11 +0000 UTC,oliversalzburg,,"We have written the needed data into your clipboard bec
Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

I have set my launch configuration up with:
```json
      ""skipFiles"": [
        ""<node_internals>/**"",
        ""*/.vscode-server/**"",
        ""*\\.vscode-server\\**""
      ]
```

Yet, while debugging a VS Code extension, VS Code keeps stepping into `/home/oliver/.vscode-server/bin/c185983a683d14c396952dd432459097bc7f757f/out/vs/server/remoteExtensionHostProcess.js`

The slashes sometimes appear as backslashes in the VSC UI. No idea why, but I figured that could be related to the problem.

VS Code version: Code 1.55.0 (c185983a683d14c396952dd432459097bc7f757f, 2021-03-30T16:01:55.261Z)

120801,OPEN,Unrespoinsive extension host 'vscode.git',,2021-04-08 09:29:59 +0000 UTC,Yajo,,"Issue Type: <b>Performance Issue</b>

I'm developing a doodba-based project (Odoo + docker-compose).

While trying to debug, the 1st time will take about 15s to connect to the debugger. The developer console says:

     WARN UNRESPONSIVE extension host, 'vscode.git' took 95% of 5664.741ms, saved PROFILE here: 'file:///tmp/exthost-14a0ee.cpuprofile'

I cannot test this without extensions because I need the python extension to debug python and reproduce the problem. However, AFAICS the unresponsiveness comes from git, which AFAIK is bundled with vscode.

After that is logged, if I debug again, it will connect immediately, as expected.

See:

Remaining issues

1. WorkspaceEdit on the content of a cell in a notebook that isn't open doesn't work:

```ts
const docUri = vscode.Uri.file('/datadrive/vscode/.vscode/notebooks/api.github-issues');
const cellUri = docUri.with({ scheme: 'vscode-notebook-cell', fragment: 'ch0000001' });
const edit = new vscode.WorkspaceEdit();
edit.insert(cellUri, new vscode.Position(0, 5), 'hello new text');
await vscode.workspace.applyEdit(edit);
```

The notebook editor is opened as expected, but the content change is not applied. I think what's happening is that the textmodel gets the change applied, but then is disposed before the notebook editor opens because nothing is holding a reference to it. How do we keep that from happening?

2. If I run setTextDocumentLanguage on a notebook that isn't open, then close the dirty editor and say ""Don't Save"", it doesn't reset the text model language, I don't know how that's supposed to work",,

I guess this is a bug? I don't think it's a feature request.. Anyhow, I'm going through a course right now for Javascript, and the provided files often have embedded javascript that uses HTML comment lines. I've looked it up on w3schools and it is valid and common practice, so it confuses me why it would come up as an error in VS Code. What I'm referring to is the sample code under ""Tips and Notes"" here: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_comment.asp (shown below as a screenshot).

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30380114/113925149-4ace3b80-97b0-11eb-9505-13c6ce7dee43.png)

Before this last update it would show as an error but didn't really bother me as it only showed the red underline (as is still done and can also be seen in the screenshot below). However, now my file names also show up in bright red every time that bit of code is used and _that_ bothers me. But I like the feature of showing files with errors in red. The problem is that it simply shouldn't be registering as an error in code.

Here is how files show in VS Code when commenting out Javascript as shown in the sample code from w3schools above.

1. execute ```vscode.window.showErrorMessage(`${'x'.repeat(100)}\n`.repeat(100), 'Action');``` in extension code (this code creates 100 lines, each containing 100 `x` characters)
2. VS Code doesn't show any message

This issue happens for `showInformationMessage`, `showWarningMessage`, and `showErrorMessage`. The issue only occurs when you pass the `...items` argument to the function (`Action` in the example above)

<!-- 🔧 Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->
Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: No, it is an error in the Extension API implementation

This results in a typical size of 42000 lines.

Most of these lines are duplicated because the schema has 3 sub-schemas for the platform sections ""osx"", ""windows"", and ""linux"". Instead of replicating the schema 3 times, we should use JSON's reference mechanism `$ref`.
With this approach we could easily bring down the size to 14000 lines.

Another area for improvement are the duplicated predefined properties. Instead of duplicating them into every sub-schema, we could try to make the sub-schema inherit from some base schema. But it could be that this is not possible in JSON schema.

I've debugged it, the URI is created, but during validation of the URI `|file` is not a valid scheme (which is correct)


I did not come across this limitation in the documentation, so I assumed that since I'm also responsible for handling the click (`handleTerminalLink`) I can have some freedom in the syntax of my own links?

From `package.json`, have a menu contribution registered for `comments/commentThread/context` to show some command with `""when"": ""commentThread != sentinelForPackageJson""`
2. From extension, call commentController.createCommentThread
3. Leave the thread's `contextValue` unassigned for now
4. Observe that the command from `package.json` is currently visible in a comment thread; type a reply and click the button for that command
5. Within the handling code for that command, assign the thread's `contextValue` to `""sentinelForPackageJson""` (similar to the example extension in `microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/blob/main/comment-sample/src/extension.ts` when handling `mywiki.startDraft`). My extension also sets the thread's `canReply` value to `false` at the same time.
6. Have another command to effectively discard the comment created with the prior command. It will set the thread's `canReply` value to `true` and set its `contextValue` to `undefined`. Observe that in this case, the command from 1 is not rendered, but the textbox to type a reply has reappeared.

I've been playing around with it, and if instead of setting the `contextValue` to undefined in step 6, I set some other random arbitrary value, then the context key is updated correctly and the command does reappear. I believe it has something to do with the slight difference in `commentThreadWidget.ts`, specifically around `_commentThreadContextValue`:
```typescript
		if (this._commentThread.contextValue) {
			this._commentThreadContextValue.set(this._commentThread.contextValue);
		} else {
			this._commentThreadContextValue.reset();
		}
```

Using the inspect context keys tool, the `commentThread` context key is still set to `""sentinelForPackageJson""`, even though the object's property is definitely `undefined` after the command in 6 runs. For some reason, it seems the lifecycle of the comment thread is latching on to `""sentinelForPackageJson""` as the default value, even though it wasn't assigned anywhere near the thread's creation time, and was only done so later after user action had taken place + the thread was updated to append a new comment.

120675,OPEN,Enable noImplicitOverride in our codebase,debt,2021-04-09 14:58:47 +0000 UTC,mjbvz,,"## `--noImplicitOverride `
TS 4.3 adds a new strictness option: [`--noImplicitOverride`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/39669). This requires that you use the `override` keyword when overriding and method:

```ts
class Foo {
   foo() {...}
}

class SubFoo extends Foo {
    foo() { ... } // ERROR: missing override specifier
}
```

To fix this, simply add the `override` keyword:

```ts
class SubFoo extends Foo {
    override foo() { ... } 
}
```

The override keyword does not change runtime behavior but can help programmers in a few ways:

- When reading code, it alerts you that a method is overriding one from the base class

- It is an error to try to override a method that does not exist on the base class. This can help catch errors caused by renaming a method in a base class but forgetting to update the method name in the subclasses.


## Enabling 
I propose enabling this new flag for both VS Code code and extensions.

Enabling it currently causes ~2200 compile errors, however unlike the previous strictness checks we enabled, I believe should simply use a script to automatically fix the vast majority of them (by inserting `override` in the necessary location)",,

120661,OPEN,Use modal dialog for initial trusted workspace,under-discussion; workspace-trust,2021-04-06 19:20:12 +0000 UTC,misolori,,"## Overview
When opening a folder that I've previously used that had several split editors and then enabling trusted workspaces, the page opens up in a small view that does not look great:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35271042/113755989-c69f8980-96c5-11eb-86b3-5d276660e6ae.png)

What is worse is you have a tiny small area to scroll through that makes it unusable.

## Proposal
Proposal would be to surface our custom dialog that allows for better focus and use of space, while still providing the same options and clicking on ""see more"" shows a more compact view of the page:

## North Star

And just to throw out this long shot, I think morphing the custom dialog to support webviews would also be good to keep this step contained without opening another tab:

## Use case
I want to use this for system files on Arch Linux where the package manager doesn't merge every system files automatically but creates `.pacnew`s that I want to merge with VSCode.

Example: 
```sh
code --diff /etc/mkinitcpio.conf /etc/mkinitcpio.conf.pacnew
```

## Possible solution

- Add context menu that deletes the file on the focused tab
   -  Note: If there is no delete permission, there is a need for `Retry with Sudo`
   -  Good to have: `Some Modifier` + `Delete` shortcut by default",,

While navigating up and down with keyboard the keyboard will stop moving for long periods of time. It does not look like it freezes. When I use the scroll wheel that seems to work but not the arrow keys at times. I can be sitting on a line and press the up arrow key and it might take upwards of 6 seconds before it starts moving. Other times it move without delay. I don't see this in any other app.

3. In the SCM view, write a commit message in the input field then select ""Commit > Commit All (Amend)"" or ""Commit > Commit Staged (Amend)"" in the context menu from the ""..."" icon.

The expected behavior is for the message of the last commit to be updated.

What actually happens is nothing. The message of the last commit is not updated and no command is shown in the git output tab.

Note that when there are staged changes or when there are no changes at all, staged and not staged, ""Commit > Commit All (Amend)"" does update the message as expected. It only does nothing when there are changes, but no staged changes.

120618,OPEN,Small user snippet issue using single quotes,snippets,2021-04-06 10:16:40 +0000 UTC,thomv-dev,,"I noticed this issue happening after the February update (I think). I'll try to explain this the best way I can. When I want to insert single quotes ' ', I press the single quote button once and 2 quotes appear. The cursor/pointer is inbetween those 2 quotes. After pressing backspace/delete, both of the quotes dissapear again. This is expected behaviour. 

Now, I use a snippet to print a console.log line, like so: 
```
""Print to console"": {
    ""prefix"": ""cl"",
    ""body"": [
	""console.log('$1');"",
	""$2""
    ],
    ""description"": ""Log output to console""
}
```

My cursor starts at `$1`, so in between the quotes. When I want to remove both quotes by pressing backspace once, only the left one deletes. This used to work like mentioned above, where both single quotes would be removed. 

When I try to manually write `console.log('');`, go in between the quotes and press delete, both of the quotes go away, which is expected behaviour. So I guess the issue lies in the snippet quotes.

As you see, when using the snippet and pressing delete afterwards, only the left one removes, instead of both. After manually typing quotes, they both delete when pressing backspace.

120617,OPEN,API Request: onDidChangeTextDocument - differentiate between user input and redo/undo,api; editor-core; feature-request,2021-04-07 16:13:03 +0000 UTC,hediet,,"The extension API of VS Code 1.54.3 offers the event `workspace.onDidChangeTextDocument` that can be used to subscribe to text changes.

Currently, it does not seem to be possible to differentiate between text changes caused by user-input and those caused by redo/undo.

This is problematic if an extension wants to use the `onDidChangeTextDocument` event to modify the document when certain characters are typed by the user.

For example, the abbreviation rewrite feature of the Lean VS Code extension makes use of it (if the user types `\alpha` it gets replaced by `α` immediately).

However, if the user undoes and redoes their changes, `onDidChangeTextDocument` is also triggered. When undoing/redoing, new text edits are very harmful though, [as they destroy the redo stack](https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/issues/259). Thus, extensions must not modify the document on redos/undos.

If `redos` cannot be differentiated from user input, this problem cannot be avoided if an extension wants to modify the document on certain text changes.

## Proposal

It would be helpful if VS Code could provide a reason that caused the text change.
Reasons could be: 
* `userInput`: The user typed a character.
* `redo`: Caused by redo
* `undo`: Caused by undo
* `unknown`: E.g. caused by liveshare or use of workspace.applyEdit

The reason could be provided by the `TextDocumentChangeEvent`:
```ts
export enum TextDocumentChangeReason {
    /** The text change is caused by extensions or other unknown sources. */
    unknown,

    /** The text change is caused by the user editing the document. */
    userInput,

    /** The text change is caused as part of an redo operation. */
    redo,

    /** The text change is caused as part of an undo operation. */
    undo,
}

/**
 * An event describing a transactional [document](#TextDocument) change.
 */
export interface TextDocumentChangeEvent {

    /**
     * The affected document.
     */
    readonly document: TextDocument;

    /**
     * An array of content changes.
     */
    readonly contentChanges: ReadonlyArray<TextDocumentContentChangeEvent>;

    // >>>>>>>>> NEW
    readonly reason: TextDocumentChangeReason;
    // <<<<<<<<<
}
```

1. Have fix on save enabled
2. Have unreachable code (for example while refactoring)
3. Press save while refactoring.
4. Surprisingly notice that after refactoring half of your code was removed.

How it should be:

1. This particular issue shouldn't be auto fixed on save, or there should be setting to disable such behavior (but who ever wants his code to be silently removed while refactoring? i guess no one).

I know this is a duplicate, but issue still exists while all similar issues were closed.

With the new change to vscode handling stderr and stdout differently TQDM now looks funny. Per Don it is writing to stderr, so the red is expected. However the blue elements might either be writing to stdout or explicitly colored blue. Should investigate.

1. Open the visual studio code integrated terminal

Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

In v1.55 the GIT status appears as an editor tab badge.  I don't want this on (too confusing at times), but when I turn it off in settings, the normail badge for showing which tabs have unsaved changes no longer persists when I move to another window (it shows the change, but then when redrawn omits it).

So it appears that now I can either have both or neither, which is a STEP BACKWARDS as far as I'm concerned!

1. Try to access the Docker Hub registry, or do ""Docker: Log In to Docker CLI""

Result: An error is shown. `(n.stack || """").split is not a function`. This is a red herring due to some bugged error parsing we're doing (microsoft/vscode-azuretools#860), but the _real_ error is: ""Error: Decryption failed""

I haven't tried this with a dummy extension but presumably the same would occur.

Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

Create a file with a non-capital first letter (ex. ""settingsButton.js"").  Open the file in vscode.  Now, rename the file within vscode, now capitalizing the first letter (""settingsButton.js"" -> ""SettingsButton.js"").  Vscode will now say that there is no file with the name you are trying to open.  I'm guessing this is because vscode does not store files as case specific, which seems like a larger issue.  Thanks!

- OS Version: Ubuntu 20 (Linux x64 5.4.0-70-generic)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a huge file (1000 lines more) already commited
2. Insert 20 lines or more at the middle of file
3. Scroll until the new lines almost disapear from screen
4. Check if the painted git indicators and scroll position are corresponding with screen

Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes

Check this print, the new lines is above the screen, but on scroll indicator the ""green"" paint is at the middle-bottom. My guess is that the size of scroll indicator is bigger than should be.

120552,OPEN,Collapsing a node in a hover placed above the line shouldn't make the hover to close,debug; under-discussion,2021-04-06 12:43:50 +0000 UTC,olivierr91,,"- VS Code Version: 1.55.0
- OS Version: Windows_NT x64 10.0.19042

When hovering a variable during debug, for example an object or an array, VS code nicely shows a navigable inline tree in a hover. Problem is, when collapsing node, if the hover appears above the line, the popup moves during the collapse, which makes the cursor to go out of the hover and makes the hover disappear. This should be fixed with a small, maybe configurable, delay where the hover  does not disappear when the cursor is out.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. In a TypeScript project, during debug, hover an array or object with nested information. Make the pop-up to appear at the top of the line, by scrolling your code up a bit if necessary.
2. Expand the top node.
3. Collapse the top node.
4. The hover moves back to it's collapsed size and the cursor is out of the hover.
5. Try to move the cursor back into the hover.

Actual results:
1. The hover disappears.

Expected results:
1. The hover shouldn't disappear.

i am observing intellisense is not working in a expected way.
when i start typing i see spelled words first, then snippets and then 'starred suggestions"" and then normal code suggestions.
i think the stars should go first and then normal code/snippets.

till a few days ago the intellisense worked as i expected. now i feel something is missing.

note: i have VS intellicode and VS intellicode insiders extensions and also code spell checker extension installed. i disabled them (individually and collectively) to verify the issue and can see the issue after disabling these extensions.

Problem:
I currently working on my plugin for Visual Studio solution files (*.sln)
(https://github.com/TobiasSekan/SolutionExtension)

And I was wonder why a merge was not show any diagnostic.
So after a little debug I have found that when I open a solution file via the SCM the `textDocument.languageId` is set to `plaintext` and not to `sln`.
I think the Problem is that the `fsPath` of the document end with `sln.git`  and not with `.sln`.
vscode itself understand this and show the correct language in the language selector (bottom right).

my current workaround for this is (`src\RegisterEvents.ts`)
```
       // this.languageId = ""sln""

        // My normal way
        if(textDocument && textDocument.languageId === this.languageId)
        {
            this.diagnostic.UpdateDiagnostics(textDocument);
            return;
        }

        // My workaround 
        if(textDocument
        && textDocument.languageId === 'plaintext'
        && textDocument.uri.fsPath.endsWith(`${this.languageId}.git`))

A setting applied in settings.json should not be updated/removed by using simple keyboard actions.

Many users set window.zoomlevel to something like 0.4 to increase the size of the window chrome since there is no other way to do it in Code. But they still need to use the keyboard zoom from time to time.

So here's what happens with window.zoomlevel in settings.json when using the keyboard zoom actions:

```
window.zoomlevel: 0.4
ctrl++:
window.zoomlevel: 1
ctrl+-
[window.zoomlevel is removed from settings.json]
ctrl++
window.zoomlevel: 1
```

What should happen if Code is respecting the user setting is this:

```
window.zoomlevel: 0.4
ctrl++:
window.zoomlevel: 1
ctrl+-
window.zoomlevel: 0.4
ctrl++
window.zoomlevel: 1

```

In other words, the user setting of 0.4 should become another step in the keyboard zoom sequence and not be removed. And using ctrl+0 when a user-defined setting is in settings.json should reset the zoom to the user-defined setting, and not remove the setting.

It's pretty frustrating to do temporary zoom-in and have the setting overwritten or deleted.

I often have to restart vscode when things get stuck (not the issue). 
I am encountering an issue where after I close and reopen vscode (without waiting a bit), vscode starts normally, and then, after a few seconds (by which I would have started working on the code again), the 'updating vscode window' comes up and forcibly recloses vscode. 

This seems to be an issue with the auto-update which occurs when vsc is closed, which I don't mind. Yet I think it should check if VSCode was reopened before forcing it to close.

So in essence I end up:
- close vsc 
- re-open vsc immediately to continue working
- start working on the code which I restarted for
- after few seconds, vsc forcibly shut by the update window 
- have to reopen vscode once again after the update

Other mac apps like mail handle this a little differently.  In Mail, the application toolbar slides down with the menu bar when it appears, so if i do accidentally pull down the menu, I can easily course-correct to hit the toolbar button I am going for.

Here's the Mail toolbar before the menu slides down:

### Unfortunately, search gets **very** annoying of one splits the Editor:
If we switch between the split Editors, it's no longer possible to just press `F3` so repeat the last search command. We have to redefine the Search and Search/Replace setting for each split editor. Therefore it's a nightmare if VSCode is used with three or four split Editors.


### Feature request: Please allow us to use *one* Search and Search/Replace function for all Split Editors

Various operations seem to hang indefinitely (with a progress indicator ""spinning""), such as searching within my workspace, staging files in the source control window, discovering tests, etc. This seems to have started happening with v.1.55.

Each child node then has right click options to perform specific tasks.  
A right click option can change the state of the child node and so I need to refresh that child node in order toe re-establish the current state and refresh the right click options.
Currently, I am having to perform a refresh on the parent node which is then triggerts onDidChangeTreeData  which then in turn triggers getChildren to go  rebuild that entire child structure below the parent. This all works but it is very  inefficient and takes time to go through and rebuild as there can be hundreds of child nodes and each is refreshed by issuing a REST api to another platform.

 I can find no documentation on how I can get access to just the specific child node from the array of child nodes that was originally created in getChildren too allow me to update just that single child entry..
 
 Is there the ability to update a single child node ? I have not found any example of suggestions in this area.
 
 Same question for deleting one single child node ?? Without having to rebuild the entire parent structure?

## Update

In my case, If I open second VSCode instance i got this error and all SSH sessions are terminated. No need to open few or close few. Just second instance triggers.

And sometimes, I had to restart my Windows because after receiving this error, even If I open 1 (one) instance of VSCode at a time, it stills disconnect from remote and unresponsive terminal error given. So, to be clear, once you get this error, its permanent. Since 2 hours I'm using single VSCode instance but I keep getting same issue every few minutes. I am going insane here.

Ideally that would also help with a ""restart"" scenario.

Looks like the number of threads is way off?

120352,OPEN,Terminal auto types random text,,2021-04-11 16:53:43 +0000 UTC,kizzle911,,"Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

I am trying to debug a powershell script in VSCode and as soon as I enter the parameter values, I get random auto entered text (see attached photos).

![Screen Shot 2021-04-01 at 11 13 30 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18578295/113316142-03413e80-92dc-11eb-8b92-80d85e7a0dab.png)

I attempted to ctrl+c but that still continues to auto enter text.

Only way to stop this is by terminating the terminal session.

By the way, the result on version 1.54.3 is right.

The new way to get the environment is async and requires that the all the configuration resolver methods be async. I have started the adoption of the new async methods in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/120326, but there's one use in terminal that looks like it will require more work:

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/02d38098249bfaff610704d74031a2530126eb6f/src/vs/workbench/contrib/terminal/common/terminalEnvironment.ts#L266-L271

Option 1: Convert that use of `resolve` to use `resolveAsync`.
Option 2: I provide a new `resolveWithEnv` method on the configuration resolver service that is sync, but requires you to pass in your own `IProcessEnvironment`. 

Which option makes the most sense here?",,

1. Scroll down in the Release Notes (in this example to ""Increased limit to 1000 lines..."")
2. Switch to another tab
3. Switch back to the Release Notes tab

Expectation: The scroll position for the Release notes is remembered and restored.
Actual behaviour: The scroll position changes each time the tab is changed (sometimes a bit scrolled up and other times a bit scrolled down)

I am not sure whether this behaviour was present in previous versions.

120307,OPEN,Fuzzy matching of file paths between client and server during remote debug session?,debug; under-discussion,2021-04-01 21:58:37 +0000 UTC,markus-breyer,,"I am working on a debug adapter implementation in conjunction with VSCode. We are using TCP/IP transport to connect to a remote cloud server which runs the actual debugged process, and all is working quite well. I am having an issue mapping source files between the remote process and the local VSCode project, since source is compiled in the cloud and file names do not match the local VSCode client 100%. For example, a file with the local path `C:\Users\Zorro\Documents\Projects\MyProject18\Content\Script\MyProject18_Logic.verse` might end up with the remote path `c:\build\Game\Plugins\GameFeatures\dea629ee-42b0-d957-1e67-7ea94c6ff0e5\Content\Script\myproject18_logic.verse`. When the user sets a breakpoint, we use a fuzzy path comparison in the debug target to match one to the other which works great. However, when we send a stack frame back to the client, VSCode does not find the path and reports an error message: `Unable to open 'myproject18_logic.verse': Unable to read file 'c:\build\Game\Plugins\GameFeatures\dea629ee-42b0-d957-1e67-7ea94c6ff0e5\Content\Script\myproject18_logic.verse' (Error: Unable to resolve non-existing file 'c:\build\Game\Plugins\GameFeatures\dea629ee-42b0-d957-1e67-7ea94c6ff0e5\Content\Script\myproject18_logic.verse').`. I understand the DAP has a ""source reference"" mechanism that allows the client to refer to source files by ID and retrieve them from the debugged process. We'd like to avoid having to store all source code on the debug target though, and also prefer the user to work directly with their local source files, so when they click up the call stack they get referred to code locations in their local project, not to unrelated source content transferred from the debugged target.

Is there a way to have VSCode fuzzy match the file paths of debugged code locations between target and client workspace? Or better, a mechanism that would allow the debug target to retrieve all existing file paths in the client's workspace (like a reverse LoadedSources request) so the fuzzy mapping can be performed in the debug adapter?

Any help and/or ideas would be appreciated!",,
120304,OPEN,VSC v1.55.0 on macos loses keyboard shortcuts,needs more info,2021-04-11 01:13:12 +0000 UTC,robayris,,"
Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

Today I updated to v1.55.0 of VSC on my mac (macos Big Sur 11.2.3).  At startup all the regular copy'n'paste, end-of-line, start-of-line keyboard shortcuts work, but once I then build and run one of my apps (Garmin Connect IQ app using the Monkey C extension v0.1.9 - which hasn't been updated for months) all those editing keyboard shortcuts, particularly copy'n'paste, end-of-line (command+right), start-of-line (command+left) stop working and I have to completely restart VSC to get them back (the shortcuts still work on other mac apps, just not in VSC).  Also, after doing this a number of times, VSC appears to become unstable and I lose connection to my Git repository, whereupon, I have to completely reboot my mac.  something is amiss.

120300,OPEN,Terminal hangs on output longer than Terminal › Integrated: Scrollback settings,,2021-04-07 21:15:05 +0000 UTC,KenYN,,"
Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

1. Set Terminal › Integrated: Scrollback to 1000
2. Run Docker inside Remote SSH session
3. Build cmake application (our particular application has a very lengthy set of installs) with `reset && cmake ...whatever...`
4. After 1000 lines, Terminal hangs

If I set Terminal › Integrated: Scrollback to 10000, for instance, this gives enough space for `cmake` to complete without problems. The original setting of 1000 worked in previous versions of VSCode, so this looks like a regression bug.

Possibly related: I had previous separated this panel from the File Explorer and made it it's own icon. However, it seems to be gone from Insiders, which I just downloaded and installed without configuring it this way.

The main benefit is isolation: Shadow DOMs should prevent css from one output rendered leaking over into another output renderer. It should also help prevent css from an output renderer leaking into the rest of the back layer webview. This isolation would not be perfect, but I think using a Shadow DOM would steer output renderers in the correct direction

**This would be a breaking change for the output renderer API**. Specifically, it would break renderers that insert global styles/scripts into the back layer webview. Code [like this](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-github-issue-notebooks/blob/bcb13e010c73d99682aaa0e4348fca79f27bc0b2/src/renderer/index.tsx#L11) from the GitHub issue notebook would no longer work (although the workaround is pretty simple: just insert the link tag into the Shadow DOM instead)

Currently, in notebooks we special case the `application/json` mimetype to be rendered with syntax highlighting in an editor. In the issue, Ethan requested a way to render code in the same way within the renderer, but this is hard for a number of reasons. Instead, it would be nice if there was a way to render other languages in the same way we special-case application/json.

Currently, language contributions already list their mimetypes

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/cdab314713b80fef92c2f9593d4a3d2dd8b9cf27/extensions/json/package.json#L38-L41

so instead of special casing JSON, we could have generic logic that can render mimetypes for any installed language in an editor.

Another way would be an optional property on the cell output...

```diff
export class NotebookCellOutputItem {

-  constructor(mime: string, value: unknown, metadata?: Record<string, any>);
+  constructor(mime: string, value: unknown, metadata?: Record<string, any>, languageId?: string);
```

but I think this is overkill where the mime type mapping could 'just work'.

**Description:** 
I am sitting behind a corporate firewall and need to use a proxy to use specific VS Code extensions like VS Code for Databricks. Unfortunately, if I set the proxy as shown below, the marketplace (& some other Extensions) fail due to

`ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT`.

Therefore, I thought I could define an exception for the marketplace using the proxy-bypass-list option. Nonetheless, it does not work and the error stays.

I even tried star versions of the market place address without any success. Furthermore, I tried to set the log-net-log flag, but no file can be found in the specific folder for some reason.

Do you have any ideas what I could try further? Without the proxy the Marketplace works like expected, but VS Code for Databricks does not.

1. Open a new file
2. Set language to C#
3. Type a line including an interpolated string  
   Ex: `var string = $""interpolatedValue={valueList.Select(value => value.ToString())}"";`

The actual colors produced have some characters (for me, `{`, `}`, `.`, `(`, and `)`) colored as though they were part of the string, not the C# code in the brackets. The expected result is that all code between the brackets (and also the brackets themselves) are colored as though they were normal code outside a string.

1. Install a node module in a clean project

        yarn add @sanity/client

2. In a `.js` file import the module using the require syntax

3. Use the imported library

## Expected result
After typing the dot, intellisense should suggest the object methods.

## Actual result
Intellisense does not suggest them

*Note*: This works when using the `import` syntax

    import sanityClient from '@sanity/client'

1) right click on any keybinding and click Change When Expression
2) select any portion of the expression you want to delete with your mouse and release the mouse button with the cursor outside of the input field but still in the same row as the keybinding (for example just quickly left-drag-select some text at the beginning without precisely timing the release of your mouse button)
3) press del-key

120177,OPEN,Sidebar panels should have individual widths,feature-request; layout,2021-03-31 17:31:01 +0000 UTC,jakeparis,,"Issue Type: <b>Feature Request</b>

Various panels in the sidebar work best at different widths. For example, extensions sidebar is helpful at a very wide width, while the file explorer doesn't need to be so wide. 

It would be a great setting if each sidebar panel would remember it's own width and automatically switch to it when switching to that panel.

1. New vscode-insiders with fresh user data dir
2. Turn on settings sync, you get the Please Sign In quick pick dialog where you can check off which items you want to synchronize

This dialog is very unnacessible. Problems:
* Once the dialog is created the ""Please sign in to synchronize"" part is not being read out by screen reader. I recommend to use a placeholder since that would nicely be read.
* Down does not move focus to the Checkboxes
* It is hard for the user to figure out there are checkboxes below. Aria label of the input box should contain this information
* Checkbox list items do not have `aria-checked` set on them. For example on how to do this, checkout [breakpoints](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/workbench/contrib/debug/browser/breakpointsView.ts#L848)

120173,OPEN,Workspace trust extension API,api; api-finalization; workspace-trust,2021-04-06 07:50:12 +0000 UTC,lszomoru,,"## Extension API
As described above, the first step to using the API is adding the static declarations to your `package.json`. The easiest method of onboarding would be to use the *onStart* value for the `required` property. Once again, this is the default behavior even if you do nothing, but it's a great signal to the user that you have made a deliberate choice. In this case, your extension does not need to do anything else. It will simply not be activated until trust is given and your extension can know that it is executing with the consent of the user. However, if your extension only requires trust for part of its functionality, this is likely not the best option.

For extensions that wish to gate their features on Workspace Trust, they should use the *onDemand* value for the `required` property, and we provide the following API:

```typescript
export enum WorkspaceTrustState {
  /**
   * The workspace is untrusted, and it will have limited functionality.
   */
  Untrusted = 0,

  /**
   * The workspace is trusted, and all functionality will be available.
   */
  Trusted = 1,

  /**
   * The initial state of the workspace.
   *
   * If trust will be required, users will be prompted to make a choice.
   */
  Unspecified = 2
}

/**
 * The event data that is fired when the trust state of the workspace changes
 */
export interface WorkspaceTrustStateChangeEvent {
  /**
   * New trust state of the workspace
  */
  readonly newTrustState: WorkspaceTrustState;
}

/**
 * The object describing the properties of the workspace trust request
 */
export interface WorkspaceTrustRequestOptions {
  /**
   * When true, a modal dialog will be used to request workspace trust.
   * When false, a badge will be displayed on the Setting activity bar item
   */
  readonly modal: boolean;
}

export namespace workspace {
  /**
   * The trust state of the current workspace
   */
  export const trustState: WorkspaceTrustState;

  /**
   * Prompt the user to chose whether to trust the current workspace
   * @param options Optional object describing the properties of the
   * workspace trust request
   */
  export function requestWorkspaceTrust(options?: WorkspaceTrustRequestOptions): Thenable<WorkspaceTrustState | undefined>;

  /**
   * Event that fires when the trust state of the current workspace changes
   */
  export const onDidChangeWorkspaceTrustState: Event<WorkspaceTrustStateChangeEvent>;
}
```

The crux of the API surface is at the bottom. We provide a property to get the current Workspace Trust state, an asynchronous method to request Workspace Trust to the user, and finally an event for listening to Workspace Trust state changes.

You will notice that the method to require Workspace Trust `requireWorkspaceTrust(options?: WorkspaceTrustRequestOptions)` takes an optional argument with a `modal` property. This `modal` value describes how the request should be surfaced to the user. It should be set to:
- **true** - when the requirement is in response to an explicit user action. For example, suppose you have a command that requires Workspace Trust to run. When the user explicitly runs this command, you should require workspace trust with this value set to *true* and await the result. This will trigger a prompt to the user with a modal dialog and should be used for explicit actions only.
- **false** - when the requirement is for a background feature of your extension. For example, suppose you want to use the workspace version of a node module to provide errors. In this case, it is best to call the function with this value set to *false* and await the result. This will trigger a UX indication that Workspace Trust is being requested but will not interrupt the user.

## Extension manifest

Extension authors will be able to declare in the extension manifest the workspace trust requirements for the extension:

```typescript
workspaceTrust: { request: 'never' } | {
  request: 'onDemand' | 'onStart',
  description: string
}
```

For the `required` property, the following values are accepted:
- **false** - The extension does not require workspace trust to perform any functionality.
- **'onDemand'** - The extension functions partially without workspace trust. Some features will be disabled until workspace trust is granted. The extension can use API to gate features.
- **'onStart'** - The extension cannot function without workspace trust. It will remain disabled until workspace trust is given.

For the `description` property, a description of why trust is needed may be provided to help the user understand what features will be disabled or what they should review before granting or denying workspace trust.

For the `safeSettings` property, a list of settings may be provided that the extension can safely read from the workspace even when the workspace is not trusted. More detail is provide on this topic below. Note that this value is relevant only when the `required` property is set to `false` or `'onDemand'` as the extension will be disabled in untrusted workspaces for `'onStart'`.",,

120164,OPEN,Debugging does not use automation shell,,2021-03-30 11:07:50 +0000 UTC,bbennetts,,"
1. launch a debugging session with cppdbg or vadimcn.vscode-lldb using a bash terminal
2. Note that the terminal launched is interactive (bash options are ""himBH"")

The documentation (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/troubleshoot-terminal-launch) states that ""terminal.integrated.automationShell.{platform} - Shell path for automation-related terminal usage like tasks and debug."" however debugging as far as I can tell is invoking the non-automation shell.  This is problematic because to be able to differentiate between an automation process (build/debug) and an interactive process (terminal launched by user) is important/useful.

Already raised a ticket versus [vscode-cpptools](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cpptools/issues/7192), but the opinion is that this is a vscode issue.

sometimes typescript keeps on showing an error and intellisense is unable to display correct suggestions, the only way to fix that is to restart VS Code.

Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

Hi, on my Mac I have the following issue which can be reproduced this way: Open VScode (Workspace loaded) the close VScode (with the x on left upper corner) but not exit it. Then if you open VScode again by open worspace from last opened files all git functions loosing and the process ""Code Helper (Rederer)"" runs on high cpu usage until you recreate your workspace. So exit VScode, remove your workspace configuration, restart VScode and create a new workspace to resolve the cpu issue and activate git functionallity.

4. **May Release**: Users targeting the latest VS Code version get the `vscode.d.ts` that uses `@link`. However users targeting older versions of VS Code will get the `d.ts` that uses our custom link scheme
5. **Post May**: All new llinks added to `vscode.d.ts` should use `@link`

120074,OPEN,Prefix-Based Suggestion Grouping,feature-request; suggest,2021-04-03 07:53:39 +0000 UTC,david-fong,,"## Proposal

Create a notion of a prefix-based suggestion grouping. Here's one possibility of how this can be configured:

```json
{
  ""editor.suggest.groupingPrefixes"": [],
  ""[html]"":            { ""editor.suggest.groupingPrefixes"": [{""prefix"": ""aria""}, {""prefix"": ""on"", ""restMatches"": ""^[a-z]""}] },
  ""[javascript]"":      { ""editor.suggest.groupingPrefixes"": [{""prefix"": ""aria""}, {""prefix"": ""on"", ""restMatches"": ""^[a-z]""}] },
  ""[typescript]"":      { ""editor.suggest.groupingPrefixes"": [{""prefix"": ""aria""}, {""prefix"": ""on"", ""restMatches"": ""^[a-z]""}] },
  ""[javascriptreact]"": { ""editor.suggest.groupingPrefixes"": [{""prefix"": ""aria""}, {""prefix"": ""on"", ""restMatches"": ""^[a-z]""}] },
  ""[typescriptreact]"": { ""editor.suggest.groupingPrefixes"": [{""prefix"": ""aria""}, {""prefix"": ""on"", ""restMatches"": ""^[a-z]""}] },
  ""[svg]"":             { ""editor.suggest.groupingPrefixes"": [{""prefix"": ""fe""}] },
  ""[csharp]"":          { ""editor.suggest.groupingPrefixes"": [{""prefix"": ""As"", ""restMatches"": ""^[A-Z]""}] },
}
```

Here's an example of the behaviour I'm thinking of, given the above settings configuration:

```html
<div ""
<div ""a
<div ""ari
<div ""aria
```

For each of the four above scenarios, the current behaviour upon triggering suggestions will include showing every aria-___ option that exists. The behaviour that I'm proposing would be that for the first three scenarios, triggering suggestions will include a single ""group"" instead of all aria-___ options. The group would have text along the lines of ""`aria ... (type ""aria"" to see more)`"", and then for the fourth scenario where the configured prefix has been fully typed out, the group will show all 48 of its contents.

### Configuration

The `restMatches` optional parameter takes a regular expression string, and is used to filter options which should be part of the group.

It may also be useful to have a `restNotMatches` parameter.

It would also probably be useful to be able to configure which types of [completion item kinds](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/editor/common/modes.ts#L445) should or shouldn't be in the group (Ex. text suggestions probably shouldn't be included in groups).

### Nesting Prefixes

I haven't thought of how nesting should be handled, but I think whatever's the least surprising is best (if there is one option that is the least surprising).

Please share your thoughts/feedback/other ideas.",,
120070,OPEN,"editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter: ""smart"" stopped working.",suggest,2021-03-29 13:59:42 +0000 UTC,mikatpt,,"
Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

Steps to reproduce:
1. In settings.json, ""editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter"": ""smart"" 
2. Type out any full suggestion and press enter
3. Expect newline, but instead it accepts the suggestion you have already fully typed.


At first, I thought this issue was isolated to a single language, as I noticed it malfunctioning on my first day learning Go. However, I then tested with TypeScript and Python and experienced the same bug. Maybe it's just on my end? Appreciate the help!

    ename: string;

When working on a new extension, i need to go into the Jupyter extension for VS Code to see what' supported.

Similarly whats the structure of the data passed into the following output items?:
* application/x.notebook.stdout
* application/x.notebook.stderr
* application/x.notebook.stream


Would it be better to have separate output items, e.g. `NotebookCellErrorOutputItem`, `NotebookCellStreamOutputItem`
```typescript
export class NotebookCellErrorOutputItem {
	constructur(value: string, error: {message?: string; name: string; stack?: string})
}

export class NotebookCellStreamOutputItem {
	constructur(value: string, name?: 'stdout' : 'stderr')
}
```

Finally, not sure why properties are named `ename/evalue/traceback`.
These names seem too tighly coupled with the Jupyter protocol. I'm ok with this, however when creating a kernel for non-jupyter or other, these don't seem right and doesn't feel like a good set of names in for the error object nodejs world.

FYI - Please consider this feedback from someone new to Notebooks (missing types/information/docs), or someone working on non-Jupyter notebooks (ename, evalue, etc seem like alient terms).

Unable to install extension 'ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers' as it is not compatible with VS Code '1.54.3'.
```

Getting Insiders isn't the problem, but I just like using the stable branch of VSCode so that bugs aren't accidentally rolled out to my IDE.

- VSCode Version: 1.54.3
- Local OS Version: Big Sur 11.2.3

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Try installing ""SSH - Containers""

120003,OPEN,Predefined variable for word under cursor,feature-request; keybindings,2021-04-01 15:17:30 +0000 UTC,andycraig,,"```

If the cursor was not within a word, it could take the value of a zero-length string.

A use case for this is to define commands for quickly summarising variables. E.g., using the following we could quickly get the length of the variable under the cursor in a Python file, when using running a Python REPL in the terminal:

```json
    {
        ""key"": ""ctrl+alt+1"",
        ""command"": ""workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence"",
        ""args"": { ""text"": ""len(${wordUnderCursor})"" }
    },
```

Other uses for this in Python would be `${wordUnderCursor}.columns` and `${wordUnderCursor}.head()` for summarising data frames.

We implement something like this in an [R extension for VS Code](https://github.com/Ikuyadeu/vscode-R#creating-keybindings-for-r-commands). `$$` is substituted with the selection, or with the word under the cursor if there's no selection, and it's quite useful. It would be nice to have something like this available for all languages that use REPLs.

Thank you for making such a nice editor!",,

        progress.report({ message: ""Still reports progress here, but we need indefinite"" });
        ...
    });
```

The scenario is rather simple – we download the file (have progress) and then extract it (do not have progress, depending on the archive format). I guess I could create new notification window, but that would just unnecessarily complicate the code. Ideally, I’d just run both actions under the same long running task and just flip the progress back to indefinite for some of the steps.

After quick conversation with @bpasero , the current API is set in stone and we can't give a new meaning to `undefined` increment. One way could be to just add new method to `Progress<>`, but it seems like not all progress locations support progress bar, so it will not make much sense for anything other than `ProgressLocation.Notification`. If we want to shove it in the generic of the `Progress<>`, then maybe just allow `{ increment: 'indefinite' }` and check for it being a string?",,

119949,OPEN,Define push model for notebook kernels,api; feature-request; notebook; notebook-kernel; under-discussion,2021-04-07 14:42:24 +0000 UTC,jrieken,,"Today, notebook kernels are operating on a pull model, e.g there is a kernel provider that returns kernels. With that approach there is an API violation since kernels aren't data-only objects and the overall the pull model causes headaches because we don't really know when to pull for kernels. Instead, kernels should use a push model, e.g extensions create kernels as managed objects and are responsible for their lifecycle.  

This means there will be a `createNotebookKernel`-function which returns a kernel instance. The kernel will have properties and functions that allow to drive the VS Code UI for a kernel (this is similar to `createStatusBarItem` or `createSourceControl`). This leads to the question what a kernel is? As far as VS Code is concerned kernels enable the execute commands, show in the status bar, and drive the kernel picker. There is no further mapping of ""actual"" kernels, the API is there to drive the UI and initiate execution. 

This leads to an API like this (rough sketches!)

```ts

export function createNotebookKernel(id: string, label: string, selector: NotebookSelector, executeHandler: (notebook: NotebookDocument, cells: NotebookCell[]) => void): NotebookKernel;

export interface NotebookKernel {

  readonly id: string;

  // select notebook of a type and/or by file-pattern
  readonly selector: NotebookSelector;

  // is this kernel selected
  readonly selected: boolean;

  // fired when kernel is selected/unselected
  readonly onDidChangeSelection: Event<boolean>;

  // UI properties (get/set)
  name: string;
  description: string;
  supportedLanguages: string[];  
  hasExecutionOrder: boolean;

  // invoked when Run, Run All, Run Selections is triggered,
  // command is invoked with [kernel, cells] as arguments
  executeHandler: (notebook: NotebookDocument, cells: NotebookCell[]) => void

  // optional kernel interrupt command
  interruptHandler?: (notebook: NotebookDocument) => void
 
  // kernels (and _only_ they) can create executions
  createNotebookCellExecutionTask(uri: Uri, index: number): NotebookCellExecutionTask;

  // kernels can establish IPC channels to (visible) notebook editors
  createNotebookCommunication(editor: NotebookEditor): NotebookCommunication;

  // remove kernel
  dispose(): void;
}

```

Details are to be defined but gist of it should be clear. Consequences that are not so obvious are the following: 

* when and iff kernels appear depends entirely on extensions and we are at the mercy of extensions getting this right, e.g be swift and painless in creating kernels (good defaults, no prompts etc). This is not novel and seems to work well enough for similar APIs, like SCM or comments.
* Not strictly a consequence of this but kernels should become ""private"" objects, e.g only the extension that creates a kernel knows about it and no public object can reference a kernel. That means `NotebookCommunication#kernel` and `onDidChangeActiveNotebookKernel` should go away. Already today that's fishy because any extension can interact with any kernel, like interrupting it or executing arbitrary cells.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Clone the extension for test purpose: https://github.com/jdneo/vscode-workspace-edit-issue
   > This extension registers `onDidCreateFiles()` event listener and will insert a snippet when a new file is created. Meanwhile, it registers a command which will apply a workspace edit to create a new file and insert some words into the file. See: https://github.com/jdneo/vscode-workspace-edit-issue/blob/master/src/extension.ts#L6-L19
2. After setup the extension, debug it.
3. Open an empty folder in VS Code
4. Trigger the command `Hello Wrold`, a file generated contains all the content from the snippet and workspace edit.
5. Remove the generated file
6. Trigger the command `Hello Wrold` again, the content from the workspace edit is not applied.

This time, I got far enough to actually think it has real promise, but I was surprised by how limited the editor was compared with an actual code editor (in my case, the JS/TS editor).

The first example I came across is not being able to hover a TypeScript type to see its definition. I soon also noticed the lack of intellisense and red error squiggles (is there an official name for these?). I'm sure there are other examples.

These deficiencies really limit the usefulness of the search editor. The particular use case that led me to submit this request was that I was trying to verify the return type of a bunch functions throughout my codebase. Not being able to just interrogate the type right in the search editor added a lot of clicks and made the process a lot more tedious than it could have been.

specifically this method I want to call (I believe):
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/792c23188984484a42007fbf8ea5aa9d43cc5b96/src/vs/workbench/contrib/scm/browser/scmViewPane.ts#L1727-L1736",,
119899,OPEN,Kernel and renderer compatibility constraints,notebook,2021-04-08 22:22:35 +0000 UTC,connor4312,,"In the initial prototype of renderers, we said that kernels would expose an interface in their preloads, and if a renderer loads in and sees that the expected interface is missing, it would be responsible for showing appropriate help to the user. However, this is not a polished experience for a variety of reasons.

In an ideal world both kernel-providing extensions and renderers statically define their compatibility ""tags"", but Jupyter kernels can be discovered and changed dynamically, so this is not possible. My plan is that:

- Kernels can expose well-known ""tags"" at runtime in VS Code (or aznb)
- Renderers statically define required or optional tags in their package.json.

This means that when we render an output, we can determine what and whether any installed renderers are compatible. With a marketplace integration that would let us search by tags, we also can suggest renderers that could be useful for the output. This is particularly important if the execution produces a mime type for which there is no existing renderer.

Currently kernels have a list of `preload` URIs, but these preloads also define the API(s) that the kernel provides. I suggest introducing a new `NotebookKernelPreload` interface that would be used instead:

```ts
export interface NotebookKernelPreload {
	provides: string | string[];
	uri: Uri;
}
```

```diff
export interface NotebookKernel {
-	preloads?: Uri[];
+	preloads?: NotebookKernelPreload[];
```

Then in package.jsons, renders could define a list of `dependencies` or `optionalDependencies`.

```json
""notebookOutputRenderer"": [
	{
		""id"": ""github-issues"",
		""displayName"": ""Github Issues Notebook Renderer"",
		""entrypoint"": ""./dist/renderer.js"",
		""mimeTypes"": [
			""x-application/github-issues""
		],
		""dependencies"": [
			""gh-issue-kernel""
		]
	}
],
```

Dependencies is a ""one of"" list -- the renderer will be considered compatible if at least one of the requested dependencies is provided by the kernel. `optionalDependencies` can be used to hint at compatibility or kernels that can allow for better integration, but aren't required. When picking a renderer to use for some new output, VS Code will prefer renderers that have an available kernel in their dependencies over those which do not.

**To be discussed:** Do we need to 'pattern match' dependencies, e.g. could I optionally depend on any ""jupyter dap"" kernel with `jupyter/*/dap` versus specifically `jupyter/python/dap`.

**Updated from discussion:** To choose a renderer for an output, VS Code will assume 'richer-is-better' and prefer:

- For each mime type in the output, choose:
  1. return renderer with a hard dependency on an available kernel, otherwise
  2. return renderer with an optional dependency on an available kernel, otherwise
  3. return any other renderer for this mimetype.
- If no suitable renderer is found, show a 'fallback' for the first mime type.  VS Code will suggest searching in the marketplace for an output renderer, and provide a button to do so.

When opening a new notebook with existing output, VS Code will choose the best available renderer assuming that whatever kernel dependency it needs will eventually be available. Therefore, renderers must be able to deal with a kernel loading in after the first render.

If a cell is executed and its output renderer is no longer compatible with the current kernel, the selection algorithm runs again.

```json
{
    ""version"": ""2.0.0"",
    ""tasks"": [
        {
            ""label"": ""taskToDependOn"",
            ""type"": ""shell"",
            ""command"": ""sleep 3"",
            ""problemMatcher"": []
        },
        {
            ""label"": ""Run this task"",
            ""type"": ""shell"",
            ""command"": ""sleep 3"",
            ""problemMatcher"": [],
            ""dependsOn"": ""taskToDependOn""
        }
    ]
}
```

119868,OPEN,Npm Scripts view not available if package.json located only in nested folder,feature-request; tasks,2021-04-02 00:00:50 +0000 UTC,IllusionMH,,"Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

Noticed that in project where there is no `package.json` file in root folder I cannot show Npm Scripts view (even from context menu on other views in explorer folder.
Structure
```
project-folder
|--backend1
|--backend2
|--static
\--ui
   |--src (contains app source)
   |--tools
   |  |--tool1
   |  |  \--package.json
   |  |
   |  \--tool2
   |     \--package.json
   |
   \--pacakge.json (main)
```

In this case unless I open any of 3 `package.json` files (in `ui`, `ui/tools/tool1`, and `ui/tools/tool2`) it's not possible to get that view, see tasks an run them. I also haven't found any command to force Npm Scripts visibility.

However as soon as I open any of them - I can see view with all 3 `package.json` files and their tasks in it.

_UPD. Removed wrong code pointers and assumptions._

Tried with default value of `npm.autoDetect` and explicitly putting `""npm.autoDetect"": ""on""` in User and Workspace settings.

Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

When running vscode in a 4K multi-monitor setup, the dropdown menus will flicker random option highlighting in the root dropdown, when you hover over sub-menu options. Then the whole menu will randomly close as you keep moving your mouse to cause the flickering. So to select any sub-menu option, you have to be quick and click on it regardless of the currently highlighted option, before the whole thing closes by itself.

This issue was introduced only in the last 2 months or so, I think.

It is fairly common place for extensions to include animated gifs in their readme. These then show up on the marketplace page on visualstudio.com, as well as in VSCode itself. Animated gifs can be fairly distracting for people with certain cognitive disabilities such as autism. For quite a few people, animations are so distracting, it is essentially impossible for them to read the text. This is captured in the [pause, stop, hide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pause-stop-hide.html) requirement of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

One way this could be addressed is for VSC to wrap each animated gif in a little widget that adds a small pause / play toggle button in the bottom right (or left for RTL languages). There are some tools to do this out there, such as [freezeframe.js](https://ctrl-freaks.github.io/freezeframe.js/) The best solution would be only to animate when the user hovers / activates the image. Make sure to make the mechanism to start/pause keyboard accessible.",,

Possibly related to #110982

I have been working on finding a way to leave a Live Share session upon a user reload. Our current strategy, based on the discussion in #110982 was to delete the Live Share workspace files during deactivate. I have built out this approach but after the  workspace has been deleted, VS Code has a workspace open with the title _Visual Studio Live Share (Workspace)_. I made the following test extension to demonstrate the behavior we are seeing. Can you explain why this behavior is happening? Is there a way to close the current workspace during the reloading process to achieve our desired behavior?

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run the attached extension
2. Open the folder C:\Users\UserProfile\AppData\Local\Temp\vsliveshare
3. From the extension development host, join a Live Share session
4. Observe the workspace be added to the vsliveshare folder
5. From the command palette, run the command __Delete temp workspace files upon reload__
6. Reload the window
7. Observe workspace folder being deleted via the logs and the vsliveshare folder

Expected Behavior: VS Code will go back to being in a fresh state with no workspaces open
Actual Behavior: VS Code has the deleted workspace open and is in a bad state 

extension.ts 

```
import * as vscode from 'vscode';
import * as path from 'path';
import * as os from 'os';
import * as fs from 'fs';

export var shouldDeleteUponReload: boolean;

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
	console.log('Congratulations, your extension ""delete-workspace"" is now active!');
	let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('delete-workspace.shouldDeleteUponReload', () => {
		shouldDeleteUponReload = true;
	});
	context.subscriptions.push(disposable);
}

export async function deactivate() {
	const LIVESHARE_WORKSPACE_TEMP_DIR = path.join(os.tmpdir(), 'vsliveshare');
	console.log(shouldDeleteUponReload);
	if (shouldDeleteUponReload) {
		await fs.readdir(LIVESHARE_WORKSPACE_TEMP_DIR, (err, files) => {
			files.forEach(file => {
				let dir = LIVESHARE_WORKSPACE_TEMP_DIR + '\\' + file;
				fs.rmdir(dir, { recursive: true }, (err) =>{ console.log(err?.message); });
				console.log(""Removed: "" + dir);

Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

Sometimes vscode just stops entering symbols while I'm typing in code editor.
You can move cursor up and down, interface is responsive but code input not working.

There's no specific action sequence that produces this behaviour that I can think of. E.g. key combination of some sort.

Since I am working with Go most of the time, it happens only with .go files.  
But this just means that I can't test different languages just for sake of testing and there's no assumptions that Go extension is responsible for this.  
Also I can't disable Go extension to test because it would decrease productivity to the bottom.

I am sure that focus is inside editor since cursor is blinking there and it doesn't work again if I click outside of editor and back (e.g. to terminal or workspace view).

Editor works again after I switch focus to another window using Alt+Tab.

However I have observer 100% CPU with basically all languages I use: Rust-analyzer, Pylance, cpptools and ESlint/Typescript. I'm guessing they're just buggy.

It's probably infeasible to fix all of those extensions, but it would be nice if VSCode at least worked around their bugginess. Currently the only effort it goes to here is the Process Explorer, but it usually doesn't even show these processes!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/376842/111989381-9672bb00-8b09-11eb-8496-302bc3ccb351.png)

No mention of pylance there! In fact it's not even showing the right window - I have several open but it's showing some random window that isn't even focused. It should surely show all windows?

I suggest the following:

1. Fix the Process Explorer so it actually shows all windows & processes
2. Add a dedicated CPU usage view for language servers/extensions.
3. If a language server/extension is detected as using 100% CPU for more than a certain amount of time, show a notification with an offer to restart it.

I would like to see- the last two settings, **Snippits**, and **Keybindings** rolled into this space.  

This is desirable for two reasons- one- it rolls up all  my settings for a project into a single file - This is mostly a useful template to start another file, but it also allows me to collect customizations specific to _that_ project.

I use this because I use Code in several different ""contexts"", not a single one.  There is still, as I complained in my initial feature request, a simple way to switch contexts.

As an  implementation, you could make it excessively passive (as with extension recommendations) so much so that  its useless, but at least its saved there...

My principle goal is to be able to switch context easily.  This is a python project. Pull in python workspace file,  all those extensions load, keybindings, load, settings load, and tasks load.

The critical use case that is overlooked at this time, when suggesting a workaround for #4504 is when collecting tasks and assigning them keybindings.  They should be kept together.

Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

1. Open the following document: https://github.com/magiblot/tvision/blob/28246145506f4397c4358fcacd6c2f4d9c89ff8f/README.md
2. Enable the document preview.
3. Do any of the following:
    * Type text near the end of the document, e.g. line 708.
    * Scroll the preview near the end of the document. Then go to Settings, search ""Markdown"" and keep toggling ""Markdown > Preview: Scroll Editor With Preview"" or ""Markdown > Preview: Scroll Preview With Editor"". 

    The preview will scroll up on each update, and so will the editor until the cursor is about to become out of sight.

To make the issue more evident, set `markdown.preview.scrollEditorWithPreview` to `false`.

The issue is reproducible even after disabling extensions with the `workbench.action.reloadWindowWithExtensionsDisabled` command.

Hello,

Despite having enabled the option to indent head & body html tags, every time I save a file, the indent is removed. I have also disabled the option to check syntax on save, so I don't know why it behaves, seems like a bug for that preference ?

Thank you

A good thing would be if one could say which outline nodes should be included or excluded in the tree graph.
This feature would make it easier to understand the flow in most programs.

I personally classify this as a bug since it seems like state that used to be remembered is now forgotten, but it's possible that the behaviour change could have been a natural consequence of a recent feature.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a Git repo with one or more subrepos.
2. Go to the source control pane. All subrepos should show up.
3. Close all but the first in the list.
4. Close and re-open VS Code.
5. All subrepos will reappear in the source control pane.

Visual Studio Code doesn't prompt for password correctly when using the new Git credential manager core (credential.helper=manager-core)

Environment setup:
Connecting to on prem bitbucket server using Active Directory credentials
Connect successfully for the first time using a test AD account then change the password on the test account.
Try to do a new push via the Source Control GUI menu ""push"" option:

The push will fail due to invalid credentials. No dialog window is displayed to enter in the new password.

Work around: at the terminal/command line, a manual ""git push"" command will display a windows dialog asking for the credentials.

If we did start using this UI element more we should consider how it can obscure the content/inputs underneath. A possible solution to this is to use `pointer-events: none` and then either hide it or set a low opacity on mouse hover. We could also link this to my proposal in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/115034#issuecomment-767592803 where ctrl+hover will force hovers not to hide and allow interaction.

This would help with the placeholder contrast issue and allow us to hide information when it's not relevant:

It's very difficult to tell at a glance which panel in VS Code has keyboard focus. I can't tell you how many times I started typing out a terminal command only to realize that the Explorer tree or an editor actually had focus.

There are two things I'd like to see:
1. A better visual indicator of which panel is the focused panel.
2. Change the appearance of the terminal cursor when the terminal doesn't have focus.

119171,OPEN,Debugger fails to attach to extension (localProcessExtensionHost.ts Could not find a free port for debugging?),debug; needs more info,2021-03-20 11:17:54 +0000 UTC,svArtist,,"Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

When trying to debug an extension project, the debugger doesn't seem to attach:

- Breakpoints are never hit, even though the extension host is running past them
- Console output is not sent to the Debug Console (very annoying)
- When I close the test window, terminating the process, the debugger doesn't get notified and keeps running
- When I stop the debugger, the test window doesn't get notified and stays open

Reproduction uncertain, I'm having about a 95% failure rate trying to debug an extension, with no changes made; it simply works some of the time.
(Race condition?)

In the ""test window"", the Developer Tools console shows ""[Extension Host] Could not find a free port for debugging"" from localProcessExtensionHost.ts

I've tried specifying some random ports in launch.json, as suggested [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/85328#issuecomment-557670543), but to no avail (in fact, I get the Warning ""Property port is not allowed."")

Same with the latest insider build.

I'm new to VS Code and dealing with the node debugger, so I don't know what to look out for yet, I'm sorry if I'm missing something obvious in this first step.
I would, for example, like to change the settings with which the extension host tries to find that port:
`findFreePort(expected, 10 /* try 10 ports */, 5000 /* try up to 5 seconds */);` to increase the default 10 tries and 5 seconds, but I can't find any settings where this would be exposed.

Question asked on Stack Overflow: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66652751/vs-code-extension-debugger-fails-to-attach](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66652751/vs-code-extension-debugger-fails-to-attach)

🐛 File opens with a strange input, as if its entire path is the file name. Also, if you open `file.json` from the Explorer, it now appears twice in Quick Open: once normally and another in the weird long format.

As you'll see in the FHS section 4.11 the directory /usr/share/ is for READ-ONLY, ARCHITECTURE INDEPENDENT, DATA FILES, not executable and library files that are compiled for a specific architecture and such. Even when using /usr/local/ you are still suppose to follow the normal rules under that directory binaries in /usr/local/bin/ shared architecture independent read-only data in /usr/local/share/, etc.. when building packages that do not adhere to these rules and lump everything into a non-conforming mess, they belong in /opt/package/ or /opt/provider/.

```json

    ""name"": ""Launch Program"",
    ""skipFiles"": [

    ""serverReadyAction"": {
        ""action"": ""openExternally"",
        ""pattern"": ""listening on .* port: (\\d+)""
    }
}
```
this however does not launch the browser because the pattern does not match the below debug console output

I guess thats caused by additional formatting symbols needed to output the fancy collapsible object.

If I change the console statement to:
```js
server.listen(12345, () =>  {
    const info = server.address();
    console.info(""listening on {address: %s, family: %s, port: %s}"", info.address, info.family, info.port);
});
```
it results in the same string output, just without fancy formatting:

and this time the pattern matches, so browser is launched.

It would be nice if the pattern matching was always performed on the simple string output, not on the fancy formatted version with collapsible objects. At the end the simple string matching is what user expects, as that is the output seen when program is launched directly (without debugging) in terminal and thus is used as a base for creating the launch pattern:

If a user misses to install an important language extension that provides debugging (like python or java), the setup of _run & debug_ makes a lot less sense. The provided defaults in _""Select Environments""_ are all meant for JS and don't give any additional context.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8599/111352510-7b073c00-8641-11eb-9b93-c3a15c3cee46.png)

In usertesting we saw most Java/Python users without the right extension give up on ""run & debug"", and one even try Chrome-debugging on a python file. None of them clicked on the nondescript _""More …""_ in _""Select Environment""_ (which opens the search for debugger extensions).

**Solutions**

The _run & debug_ viewlet and setup prompt could use file and workspace recommendations to highlight a shortlist of extensions that the user should install to make debugging easier.

We could start with a small scope for Java, C++ and Python and run this as experiment.

In return, it allows for notebooks that aren't stored on disk or are composed of multiple files (like a directory is a notebook). However, the internals that connect to the content provider assume that one notebook is one file. Making this assumption (once it is correctly implemented) makes the life of notebook extension authors much simpler: vscode can take care of file watching, concurrent write etc etc. However,  when the internals take soo much responsibilities than the current API is too complex: it can be a simple as converting bytes to notebook data and vice versa. 

This issue is about adding such a new simplified API. This is the proposal

```ts
export interface NotebookSerializer {

```
- OS Version:
```
macOS Big Sur
11.2.3
```
- Problem
If using `code .` (command line), this issue is not present.
If starting VSCode from e.g. macOS Spotlight, `BBEdit` will fail with this error:
```
$ git -c core.quotepath=false -c color.ui=false difftool --no-prompt --tool=bbdiff -- app.py
You must allow `bbdiff` to send events to the BBEdit application.
Use `tccutil reset AppleEvents` to reset the system's permissions, and try again.
bbdiff: error: -1743
fatal: external diff died, stopping at app.py
```
Steps to Reproduce:

1. Use a git project, e.g., `git clone https://github.com/alanwilter/flask-pytest-example`
2. Add to your `~/.gitignore`:
``` bash
git config --global diff.tool bbdiff
git config --global difftool.bbdiff.cmd 'bbdiff --wait --resume ""$LOCAL"" ""$REMOTE""'
git config --global difftool.prompt false
```
2. Start VSCode via Spotlight
3. Change file `app.py` and save it.
4. Open a terminal (cmd-J) inside VSCode
5. Run this command:
``` bash
git -c core.quotepath=false -c color.ui=false difftool --no-prompt --tool=bbdiff -- app.py

Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes

When you want to verify whether the extension is causing the problem in the remote development environment, select the command to disable the extension and reload the window in the command panel, and hope that the disabling of the plug-in related to remote development can be excluded, because the above The command to disable extensions and reload the window also disables the remotely developed plugins, so you need to re-enable the relevant plugins and reload the window, so that other plugins that you don't want to close are also enabled.

**Workaround**

1. Open Activity Monitor and kill the process generically named ""Electron""
2. Verify that any ""Code Helper"" & ""Code Helper (GPU)"" processes have disappeared after this
3. Relaunch VSCode the normal way (e.g. from Dock icon)

**Comments**

This appears to be the same issue as #81970, where a number of comments at the bottom are expressing confusion about how to apply the workaround – but I can't comment there to clarify the workaround since it's locked 😢

It wasn't explicitly mentioned there that you have to kill a process called ""Electron,"" and if you interpret the workaround as killing processes named ""Code"" then you get into an infinite whack-a-mole trying to kill the lingering ""Code Helper"" & ""Code Helper (GPU)"" processes – they change PID every few seconds. Even if you multi-select in Activity Monitor and Force Quit all of them at once, more are respawned a moment later.

**However,** regardless of the workaround I believe this is a real bug that should be kept open.  OS reboots are not _that_ rare, and if it's common for VSCode to inexplicably become un-launchable afterward, that really should be fixed.

(#22449 and #110202 seem likely to be other reports of this this same issue as well. _Possibly_ #8119, #18521 too).",,

This is an example using the prettier-vscode extension.

1. Install prettier-vscode 6.2.0.
2. open a nodejs project that has prettier installed in node_modules
3. open a .js file
4. Prettier will ask ""Do you allow the execution of this Prettier version""

at this point, prettier-vscode has set a value `PRETTIER_MODULE_ALWAYS_ALLOWED: true` in its globalState.

6. Uninstall prettier-vscode.

prettier-vscode state is still in globalState:

8. `cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code\ -\ Insiders/User/globalStorage`
9. `sqlite3 state.vscdb 'select * from ItemTable where key like ""%prettier%""'`

if I re-install prettier-vscode, it will use the previously saved state.

this makes it hard to do a ""clean reinstall"" of an extension without doing a clean reinstall of vscode itself.

Let's imagine some hypothetical bad code that resulted in exception either because bad or unfamiliar third-party libraries and focus on speed of issue resolution:

```python
import pandas as pd
pd.DataFrame(42)
```

Upon executing this, we get an exception. As professional IDE user, I expect a consistent behavior and exception stack trace rendered like a normal stack trace - something compact, with clickable lines, that get me to correct lines of code, causing the error. I do not want to open search bar in the project, then figure out that this is not the error in the project i'm working on, but rather in third-party dependency, because that way i have to go, figure out where the sources of that dependency are, open another editor, find references, etc etc. I also really don't want to see the same exception message for 3 times. Practically speaking, we can make hiding of stack traces as opt-out feature. If make with bottom-right notifications popup - even better :) 

VSCode has a nice stack trace rendering widget in debug mode, so that one could be just re-used in this beautiful extension, so that I'd see consistent UX across different parts of the editor for the same type of things.

## Run action on all selected cells

The simplest solution is merging all selected cells into one. It's intuitive as all cells in the selections will be merged, which is never ambiguous. 

## Run action per distinct selection

Imagine we have a notebook with 5 cells 

```
  python_1,
  python_2,
  md_1,
  python_3,
  python_4
```

Python cells 1, 2, 3 and 4 are selected, so we have 2 distinct selections, `{ start: 0, end: 2 }`, `{ start: 3, end: 5 }`. After users run Join Cells:

```
  'python_1
  md_1,
  'python3
```

Each distinct selection shrinks into a single cell.",,

1. Open an existing text file in VS Code.
2. Make an obvious change to it (e.g. insert a line of additional text)  but do not save the dirty file.
3. Open the same file in another editor (I used Notepad).
4. In that editor make a change that doesn't alter the file's length (e.g. replace a lowercase letter with an uppercase one). Save this change.
5. Back in VS Code, save the change you made in step 2.
6. :bug: No dirty write warning appears. Instead the change made in step 4 is lost.

Default mac os dictation dictation tool (part of Accesibility) stops working after first use.

Setup:


Steps to Reproduce:
1. On a Mac OS X computer, add a keyboard shortcut for the text-to-speech accesibility tool

2. Open vscode on any project that contains text (e.g. a markdown file), select a paragraph and press the keyboard shortcut defined in step 1 (CMD+OPTION+CTRL+L in my case) and you will hear the computer read the text to you.

3. Select another paragraph and press the keyboard shortcut again   
**EXPECTED**: computer to read the text again, like in step 2  
**OBSERVED**: a ""terminal bell"" sound is heard and nothing happens (no error printed even when running in --log=debug mode)

Impact:

 - Broadly for accessibility: major—users who use and depend on text-to-speech tools on Mac OS cannot currently use vscode

118947,OPEN,Search editor: leverage text file model support and behave like normal text editors,debt; important; search-editor,2021-04-06 05:50:13 +0000 UTC,bpasero,,"In the context of https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/117873 I was doing a quick research how working copy providers that are text file model based are implemented today and found 2 examples:
* custom text based editors
* search editors

When you look at `CustomTextEditorModel` you can see how every IO related method (like `save` or `revert`) is going into the manager of text file models, e.g.:

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/5d5b9dd0a8bb3351a544cf3084c619dfd62ebf8f/src/vs/workbench/contrib/customEditor/common/customTextEditorModel.ts#L95-L95

This has the advantage that a lot of corner cases for saving are being taken care of that prevent data loss or corruption.

When looking at search editors, I see that a (code editor) model is being resolved or created here:

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/71776589163b831768c408bcad2a87d73941bbb6/src/vs/workbench/contrib/searchEditor/browser/searchEditorModel.ts#L61-L61

But the IO logic is all implemented custom, e.g.:

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/57488b5430311ecdd7111d15ea4df5b489187807/src/vs/workbench/contrib/searchEditor/browser/searchEditorInput.ts#L128-L128

As such, your custom search editor is a good candidate for adopting the text file model approach, similar to custom text editors.

I am inclined to mark this `important` because I think you really should not implement the IO logic yourself, but maybe there are no issues with your implementation either, so I leave it as `debt`.

118938,OPEN,Error when trying to rename or delete folder with git repo inside,,2021-03-20 11:17:53 +0000 UTC,Shaddaaa,,"Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

1. Open some folder A with VSC
2. Create a new folder B inside that folder A.
3. Initialize a new empty git repository inside folder B.
4. Try to delete or rename B from inside VSC. Either through the VSC-Explorer or through the embedded command line tool. Rename will fail completely, resulting in a permission error. Deleting is not able to move to recycle bin, only deleting permanently. Elevating permission level to admin does not fix the issues.

Error when renaming:  
```Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, rename 'e:\path\to\folder' -> 'e:\path\to\renamedfolder'```  

Errors/Dialogs when deleting:
1. Dialog asking if I'm sure I want to delete? (I click yes)
2. Win-Dialog saying that access was denied, it needs elevated permission. (I grant permission)
3. typical Win-Dialog to give VSC admin permission (I grant permission)
4. Dialog saying deletion failed, asking if I want to permanently delete instead.

I tried integrated powershell, terminal and right click folder -> rename, all fail inside of VSC.  
Strangely deleting and renaming do work if I do them fast enough after starting VSC, while it is still loading my folder I assume?  
On the other hand using the Windows Explorer or the Windows Terminal to delete or rename works flawlessly, without any need for admin permissions.  

My guess would be it's something about Source Control doing weird things?

<!-- 📣 Issues caused by an extension need to be reported direct to the extension publisher. The 'Help > Report Issue' dialog can assist with this. -->

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a Visual Basic file (.vb)
2. Type:
```
if True then
    ' Some code  
end if
```

**Expected:** When you type ""End If"", the indentation will go back to the same level as the opening block (""if""), as can be seen above.

**Actual:** The ""end if"" stays in the wrong indentation level:
```
if True then
    ' Some code  
    end if
```

**Possible cause and solution**:
I found out that this can happen in all programming languages where a closing tag includes the opening tag as a separate word (For example: _If ... End If_, or _While ... End While_).

**Solution:** This is related to the order of the pieces as defined in [these lines of code in the richEditBrackets.ts file](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/a699ffaee62010c4634d301da2bbdb7646b8d1da/src/vs/editor/common/modes/supports/richEditBrackets.ts#L228)

- If you change the order so that first the **closing** brackets would be pushed and only then the **opening** brackets, then it will work.
- Alternatively, you can modify the _createBracketOrRegExp_ function and just add a reverse() function there.

I'm not sure if it will mess things up or not (though my initial tests look promising) and I'm not too familiar with the code to change it myself and issue a PR, so please take a look and let me know what you think.

    - ⚙️ `:gear:`
    - ⚡️ `:zap:`
    - ♻️ `:recycle:`
    - ✔️ `:heavy_check_mark:`
    - ✏️ `:pencil2:`
    - ♿️ `:wheelchair:`
2. You will see that they all look like this:
    <img width=""181"" alt=""Screen Shot 2021-03-13 at 10 27 29 PM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62190025/111056216-55b0dd00-844b-11eb-8955-5aaa15f04304.png"">
3. I haven't tested all emojis. But most others seem to be displaying as expected. For example, 
    <img width=""198"" alt=""Screen Shot 2021-03-13 at 10 31 21 PM"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62190025/111056289-d8d23300-844b-11eb-8914-08bf4bd274cd.png"">
4. I've copied and pasted emojis from many different websites. I get the same results each time.

**Problem 2: The reason that I am adding these emojis to my project is to configure `git commit` prompts using [commitizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen), specifically with [cz-customizable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cz-customizable). When the `git commit` prompts are generated in my terminal, some emojis show inaccurate spacing. Additionally, all of the emojis that are displayed without color in VS Code files are being displayed in Terminal in the same way (no color, inconsistent sizing)**
1. I'm adding emojis specifically to my **.cz-config.js** file (you can see an example of someone else doing this [here](https://gist.github.com/leohxj/7bc928f60bfa46a3856ddf7c0f91ab98)).

2. Here are some of the spacing issues I see in my `git commit` prompts in **VS Code `node` terminal**:
    - The text that comes after the ⚙️ `:gear:`, ♻️ `:recycle:`, and ⚡️ `:zap:` emojis are not aligned with the text after all of the other emojis, even though there is only 1 space after each in my **.cz-config.js** file. The ⚡️ emoji strangely shows what looks to be more than a single space after it.

    - The 🛠️ `:hammer_and_wrench:` and ⬇️ `:arrow_down:` emojis, although displaying correctly, do not show a space after.

    - The :arrow_up: `:arrow_up:` emoji should have a space after it

3. Here is the results when I attempt to use my new `git commit` prompts in a non-VS Code terminal (I am using my macOS terminal version 2.10)
    - All of the emojis are being displayed correctly in this terminal (color, size), **but** there are still some spacing issues. Spacing issues occur with all emojis **except** ⚡, which appears fine.

118893,OPEN,Using key commands to scroll to top or bottom of document does not incorporate editor.paddingTop and editor.paddingButtom,,2021-03-20 11:17:53 +0000 UTC,markjaquith,,"
This was unexpected for me. I have these top/bottom padding settings enabled because I don't like the top or bottom of my code jammed up against the UI or the bottom of the window, and when I use the keyboard to ""go to the top"" or ""go to the bottom"" I mean both ""put the cursor on the first/last line"" and ""scroll maximally in that direction"".

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Set `editor.paddingTop` and `editor.paddingBottom` to `120`.
2. Scroll to the top with the mouse (120 padding shows — good).
3. Scroll to the bottom with the mouse (120 padding shows — good).
4. Press the key command to scroll to the top of the document (⌘-↑ on macOS... presumably ""Home"" on Windows?).
5. Note that the first line is at the top of the viewport, with no 120 padding.
6. Press the key command to scroll to the bottom of the document (⌘-↓ on macOS... presumably ""End"" on Windows?).
7. Note that the last line is at the bottom of the viewport, with no 120 padding.

Steps to Reproduce:

3. Ensure the Editor: Wrapping Strategy is set to ""advanced""
4. Create a markdown file
5. Type some text surrounded by double asterisks or beginning with `# ` to format with **bold**.
6. Word wrapping occurs as though the text weren't bold, but bold text is wider and thus causes horizontal scroll

118851,OPEN,Debian freezes repeatedly: vscode + nvidia driver,,2021-03-20 11:17:53 +0000 UTC,RossBoylan,,"
Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

I recently installed VSCode and julia, including the julia extension for VSCode, onto a Debian GNU/Linux buster system with nvidia proprietary drivers.

Since then the system has repeatedly become unresponsive, often while working in vscode.  This includes repeated times I had to restart the computer, as well as ones for which I was able to recover.  Unfortunately, the failure is not deterministic as far as I can tell.

This morning I had a near fatal experience; I got back enough control to enter a text mode terminal, kill some competely unrelated processes, and  watch responsiveness slowly restored.  When I came back to my main desktop with VSCode, the contents of both the Julia REPL and the bash shell inside of VSCode that I had been using had been replaced by a few stray colored lines.  Scrolling around or highlighting and selecting did not bring anything more back.

This afternoon, while in emacs, it entered some loop consuming more memory, and I had to restart the computer.

Here are some entries in the kernel log.  Note repeated entries this morning involving failures from code's invocation of  libnvidia-glcore.so.418.181.07.  I've included stuff from the harder failure this afternoon, although it has no references to code or nvidia.

1. Issue https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/20234#event-4452251253 referred me to https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Native-Crash-Issues#creating-and-symbolicating-local-crash-reports so I followed those steps, i.e. run `""code --crash-reporter-directory <absolute-path>"" `
2. Install the C/C++ extension, version 1.2.2.
3. Do the repro steps at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cpptools/issues/7085, which are ""git clone https://github.com/thedmd/imgui-node-editor"", open imgui_node_editor_internal.h, click the ""Link"" identifier on line 739. That should cause VS Code to launch cpptools, which in turn launches cpptool-srv (which crashes).
4. Wait for it to crash -- it'll need to out-of-memory (so you should see memory increasing by the GB).

Bug: No crash report is generated at the crash-reporter-directory-folder (it gets populated with some other files by VS Code).

Debugger will not work.  I will attach project created.

The debugger will not connect to the Local project.  It is running as I can call the function in the browser fine.  But the debugger can't seem to connect to the process.  I have tried to manually connect and can't get breakpoints to work.

118838,OPEN,Dialog windows appear on different screen when using second monitor,,2021-03-13 15:16:30 +0000 UTC,DarrenCook,,"Electron: 11.3.0
Chrome: 87.0.4280.141
Node.js: 12.18.3
V8: 8.7.220.31-electron.0
OS: Linux x64 4.18.0-25-generic

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Have vscode running on a second monitor.
2. Do any action requiring a pop-up dialog, such as File|Save As, File|Open, or Help|About. It opens on the first monitor.

I've also tried dragging the dialog across to the second monitor, in the hope that it would then memorize the monitor. But the next dialog still opens on the first monitor.

This is a pain, because I've been turning the screen off on my notebook while using the second monitor.

This is an exact duplicate of #104550, which says that upgrading to the ""latest stable"" as of Nov 2020 fixed it. But I've just upgraded from 1.53.2 to 1.54.2 and it made no difference. (Also disabling all extensions and restarting made no difference.)
That issue was locked so I was forced to start this new issue. I don't know if it was fixed and then broke again? Maybe @rhaschke can comment, and we can try and narrow down the system differences.


**ADDITIONAL TROUBLESHOOTING**

* It still happens whether the app is normal of maximized.
* Exact same problem with Chrome.
* I have the notebook monitor set to be ""primary"" display. If I swap this over so monitor 2 is the primary, then the behaviour is completely reversed. Now system dialogs open on monitor 2, whether I have vscode (or chromium) on monitor 1 or 2!
* Firefox does not have this problem, not does xed (so it is not all apps). Gimp always uses the notebook monitor (i.e. ignores the ""primary"" setting).

Is there any configuration option in vscode to control this behaviour? Or anything I can try?

If not, this might have to be marked as ""broken in upstream""?

Issue Type: <b>Feature Request</b>

With the new `selectionNavigation` mode, users can easily go from single selection mode to multi selection by press shift+arrows. I would expect pressing `escape` key to revert back to single focus/selection mode but now it  clears focus and all selections. Something we can consider

* Users select mutiple cells 
* Escape will shrink selections to single focus/selection
* Another escape will then clear all selections + focus

Kernels often print stdout/stderr content with the assumption of being connected to a terminal. With that mindset they send ANSI sequences. Some of those sequences we support, like colors. We current don't support the sequence that clears the screen and that forces the jupyter extension to employ funny workarounds: they scan all output for that sequence, remember that so that they can clear the output before appending the next chunk.

If I restrict my investigation to one particular short file (which is checked in but untouched for years) I see a scroll-sychronised matching pair of windows of that file.

The output window shows that for one particular 14 line script it does

Using git 2.29.2.windows.3 from C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe
.
> git show --textconv HEAD:\\server\share\....\a-sourcefile.ext
then twice > git ls-tree -l HEAD -- \\server\share\....\a-sourcefile.ext

At least it hasn't gone and actually staged stuff without asking which is what Atom did when I tried it a few years back.

I am baffled as to why it thinks I have modified files. If I point TortoiseGit at the same UNC (rather the parent working directory) it does correctly interpret things.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to the [""Download Visual Studio Code""](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) page
2. Click the Windows button (= User Installer) or the ""System Installer"" ""64 bit"" button
3. Receive and launch ""VSCodeSetup-x64-1.54.2.exe""
4. When the EULA is displayed, scroll to the bottom
5. Note on the last line: ""EULA ID: Visual Studio Code 14 November 2018""
 
### Analysis

- With the exception of formatting and trivial URL changes (e.g. master vs. main in the GitHub URL and http vs. https in some other URLs), the installer EULA seems to be a match to [latest EULA on the website](https://code.visualstudio.com/license), which is required to download the installer (""By downloading and using Visual Studio Code, you agree to the license terms and privacy statement."")
- In contrast, it seems much less similar to a [2018-11 EULA that I found on Archive.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20181111155202/https://code.visualstudio.com/License), so I’m presuming that the 2018 “EULA ID” string is erroneous.

I was using this functionality in the Live Share extension to get notebook contents from the host when the guest opens a notebook document that the host doesn't yet have open. The notebook should be opened with the content provider that the guest selected (if it's not already open on the host).

In general, there needs to be a programmatic way to open a notebook document, and part of that is specifying the view type. I imagine there are other scenarios where an extension would want to open a notebook behind the scenes and not prompt the user to select a content provider. This isn't possible without being able to specify the view type.

Also, on the Source Control tab, VSCode is not always properly reflecting the number of pending changes. The window was showing no changes, then after switching to other windows and returning to VSCode it finally showed the correct number of changes, but this was multiple minutes after the last save. I put these two issues together because they do seem to be related and started happening at the same time.

I would expect that saving a line with a change should show a color block on the right scrollbar, and I would expect that the source control tab would immediately increment the number pending changes.

For details see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20896507/why-does-browser-block-popup-windows-in-callback-but-not-otherwise and https://www.yaplex.com/blog/avoid-browser-pop-up-blockers and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22007592/chrome-window-open-after-ajax-request-acts-like-popup

We probably need to use the suggested fix/workaound when opening the debuggee window in VS Code.

The tricky challenge is that for extension debugging the request for opening a new tab for the debuggee comes as a call back from the debug adapter/extension.
And the only user action (where the tab could be created without running into the popup blocker), is the ""Start Debugging"" (or ""F5"") action. But for this action VS Code does not really know upfront that a new tab will be needed...  

In theory we could always create a tab (without bringing it to front) when starting extension debugging. And if js-debug calls back into VS Code for launching the debuggee, we would populate the tab and bring it to front. And if no call back is received within some period of time we would close the unnecessary tab.",,

3. Instead of starting in your workspace you start at Powershell Path

Expected result: the terminal spawns at the root path of your workspace. It is caused by the [] brackets.

I haven't look at the code as it is a relatively big project but with PowerShell to navigate into a folder with brackets you need to format the destination path like this:
```ps1
# Does not work
cd E:\Projects\[Name]
# Works
cd 'E:\Projects\`[Name`]'

I'm just trying out Visual Studio code for the first time and I wanted to run one of my custom services I wrote on some selected text.

118667,OPEN,Remove use of assert.equal from the code,debt; engineering,2021-04-01 15:31:50 +0000 UTC,lramos15,,"The code base currently uses a mixture of `assert.strictEqual` and `assert.equal` for mocha testing. However, `assert.equal` is deprecated meaning overtime it may break or cease to work. We also see ugly strike throughs in many of our tests. See https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html#assert_assert_equal_actual_expected_message for more info on the deprecation. 

**Proposal**
My suggestion is that we make an effort to remove all `assert.equal` use cases from our code base since it's been deprecated since version 9.9 of node. We currently have 3,697 uses of assert.equal.


# Progress

- [x] `assert.equal` removed

118661,OPEN,Temp output of Write-Progress is not removed correctly and blends into the main output (making the output unusable),,2021-03-29 19:10:08 +0000 UTC,DEberhardt,,"Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

1. Execute Script via CmdLine or Run that has Write-Progress in it.
2. Terminal output does not correctly remove the Progress. and leaves the ""overlay"" on screen leaving the output incomplete or worse incorrect.

### Detail
Executing Write-Progress in the VsCode Integrated Terminal window leaves Progress window drawn in the terminal overlaying the actual output below.

First I thought that it occurs when followed by a `ForEach` where the Progress is written with the Same ID or one higher, but that is not the case.
Then I investigated whether my scripts are missing the `Write-Progress [...] -Completed` message at the end - they do not (even when they are missing (shame on me!) the windows are not correctly removed. Adding the `-Complete` Step at the end does not make a difference). The Progress window is expected to be removed. This behaviour is correct in PowerShell and PowerShell ISE, but not in VSCode.

Not all of them display the same behaviour though. My Module makes heavy use of Write-Progress to indicate, well, progress, especially for longer running tasks.

<!-- 📣 Issues caused by an extension need to be reported direct to the extension publisher. The 'Help > Report Issue' dialog can assist with this. -->

Testing with Extension Bisect has yielded the following result:
- When opening a new window without Extensions (`code --disable-extensions`), the issue did not occur
- When then starting Extension bisect from this window and repeating it 7 times, the issue did not occur.
- When starting Extension bisect from the main window that currently exhibits this issue, it occurred at the first step (after disabling all extensions)

118630,OPEN,Keytar causes crash on Stable; but not Insiders?,,2021-03-23 14:21:00 +0000 UTC,marceau-maubert,,"Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

I don't know at which point this started happening, but starting an instance of Stable now crashes a few seconds after, with parameters `code --verbose -n` I get this:

```
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'char const*'
/dev/fd/3: No such file or directory
Server response:
```

I figured out after looking through the issues that it might be related to Keytar and that there was a new command line parameter to turn it off, which did resolve the issue. My credentials are however no longer being saved, of course, so that's not really a nice solution, considering how Insiders works just fine somehow. 

I'm not using Snap to install either. I tried upgrading `libsecret-1-0` manually since that seems to be something Keytar depends on and Ubuntu might be behind, but to no avail, and that was really just a shot in the dark.

Is this something on my end that I should fix? Is there any way I could get more useful information to debug?

Hi,

the issue is the following: since both variables (`${workspaceFolder}` and `${pathSeparator}`) are expanded with backslashes, the Git Bash terminal will not recognize the path, and therefore it will create a wrong directory (basically, a directory with the name ""C:\work\example\..\test_dir"").

So, to fix this issue, the variables should be expanded according with the used integrated terminal, or, as an alternative, there should be a manipulation method to get the path in the desired form.
The former approach is the simpler for user setup, but the latter is slightly more flexible, so implementing both is the most general approach to get an out-of-the-box solution (best user experience), which can be fine-tuned whether required.

Regards.

Other than using i3, my Ubuntu install is pretty standard. I just upgraded totday from 1.52.1 to 1.54.1, so this issue may have been introduced before 1.54.1.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open a vscode instance
2. Open a new window in vscode (Ctrl + x Ctrl + n)
3. Navigate to another virtual desktop in i3
4. Navigate back to the virtual desktop with the two vscode windows.
5. If the issue occurs, you should see the contents of the previous virtual desktop, instead of the contents of the vs code windows.

As a workaround, you can switch the i3 container layout to stacked or tabbed and back again to force a redraw.

This is how it looks on my desktop:

While `narrow` is great for small spaces, it hides key information like the icon, rating and download numbers. For users who don't discover the resizing, important context is lost for extensions. I noticed this during my work on getting started, as it guides users early into the extension panel; which looks no very inviting without expanded.

Ideas for solutions

- Trigger narrow for ⪬ 250px
- Add a size before narrow that allows more context like a smaller extension icon and simpler rating, or other redesign ideas.

118489,OPEN,ALT doesn't select the top menu in marketplace tabs,,2021-03-10 10:11:56 +0000 UTC,Hadakajime,,"
Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

whilst reading ""Release Notes: 1.54.1"" I attempted to try pressing ALT to highlight the top menu. It doesn't work. Switching to a tab that is for an open file - then ALT works. Switching back to the relase notes - ALT doesn't work.

There should be consistency. ALT should highlight the top menu.

Unfortuntately, it seems the marketplace is given special treatment: ALT doesn't work; pages don't cache and instead refresh every time you switch tabs; etc etc.

Claiming that vscode is just an editor is farcical. This isn't notepad or gedit. It has a whole marketplace, it runs plugins and supports automation. It already implements chromium... why can't you simply cache a marketplace page? I can open multiple files of several thousand lines simultaneously, yet it refuses to cache a simple plugin description page? Why? Scared that it will have to use some precious RAM?

It ruins the user experience.

  - Commands and flows that open new tabs need to be opened side-by-side with getting started.
  - New projects currently open a new window. Could either open in current window (if empty) or with getting started restored.
- Most extension Welcome pages offer focus on the multiple ways to get started: _Open folder_, _Open file_, _New file_, _New file type x_ (from template), _Create project_ (from wizard), etc

While these errors showed up all functions in vscode are  down even the report an issue.
Then I run F1 > Help: Start Extension Bisect I can use the issue reporter again.But it's still not solve my problem and again the error ""The terminal process terminated with exit code: 127"". pop up again. 
If I go to Ternimal > new ternimal the error pop out immediately.

Originally reported in #107386, which was closed as fixed, even tho I didn’t have success verifying myself back then. So, I suppose it’s probably a regression in recent releases.

118361,OPEN,Debugging projects on mounted and linked folders not working,debug,2021-03-07 21:06:19 +0000 UTC,viktor-c,,"Hi everyone!

I have to post a new issue because this made me mad in the last days. I am running Linux and have simlinked a folder from another partition to my home folder for easy access. (Big mistake ! :)) )

I have created a simple electron app which I couldn't get to stop on set breakpoints. I would always get `breakpoint set but not yet bound`. 
I downloaded an example app from github for electron and followed the tutorial and still not get it to break. 
Following #62364#issuecomment-434988390
``` ""stopOnEntry"": true ```  it then eventually do break. 

Back to my project it would also break but under ""loaded scripts"" it would not open my `main.js` file to debug and it wasn't bound. But I did see that it would open a `main.js` file with another path, using my absolute path. 

This got me to this issue and comment from ghost https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/34627#issuecomment-437045319_

For further reference, if somebody has **linked folders** from **other partitions**, one must open the `vscode workspace file` and edit the relative path of the workspace or working folder to an absolute path.

Originally posted by @ghost in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/34627#issuecomment-437045319_ 
This also occurs if your project is on a different partition and you have a symlink to the parent directory of the the project folder. vscode will follow the symlink path instead of the real path.

Say you have ~/projects -> /mnt/data/projects
vscode will open a file using this path ~/projects/pro1/file instead of using the absolute path.

This prevents git markings from showing and you have to manually refresh the source control to see the changed files list.

My **work around** is replacing the project path from ""."" to the absolute path to the project in the workspace file:
```
     ""path"" : ""../projects/pro1""
```
change to 
```
""folders"": [
    {
        ""path"": ""/mnt/projects/pro1""
    }
],
```

118338,OPEN,Custom Extension Activity Bar Icon Disappears,bug; workbench-views,2021-03-24 16:09:50 +0000 UTC,doug-shontz,,"I am in progress of updating an extension.  The extension adds an activity bar icon to help manage a custom server I am creating.  I have had the extension on the marketplace for about a year with no issues with regards to the icon being used.

With the latest update, I find that, when I hit F5 to debug, the activity bar icon randomly ""disappears"" from the left sidebar.  I can pretty well duplicate it by doing the following:
- Closing out of Code
- Relaunching from scratch
- F5 to debug the extension
- The icon will show up on the first time through.
- I close the Extension Development Host
- I relauch F5 to debug
- The ""spot"" where the icon is supposed to be still ""works"" (i.e. the action button still launches the extension), but the icon itself is blank

Things I have tried:
- Totally cleaning out my Code install and reinstalling from scratch so that there are no extensions or customizations.  Can reproduce still.
- Trying a number of different icons.  Same result.
- I did try going back one version (1.53).  Doing this fixed the issue and the icon never disappears with no change to my codebase at all.

I looked through the documentation and saw nothing that would indicate the requirements have changed for the icon and this is the one I've been using for a year, so I can only surmise perhaps something changed in this release?

Issues #31175 and #32647  suggests that old extensions should be automatically deleted on restart. That is not what I an seeing. As you can see from the listing of my extensions directory below there are multiple versions of the same library. The python extension has 9 versions! Restarting vscode doesn't make any difference. 

The space available on my home directory is very limited, so the ~/.vscode directory is a symbolic link to another drive.

Is it safe for me to manually delete all the older versions ?

In the beginning, the _Accept Resolution_ button would be inactive.

The scope of the buttons [1] and [2] would be the currently select change (using the buttons _Previous_/_Next Change_) only. Pressing one of those buttons would mark the currently select change (i.e. conflict) as resolved and when all conflicts are resolved, the button [3] would become active allowing me to accept the resolution and save the resulting content into the file. That way, I can go through all changes one by one and quickly and easily accept or reject each one without manually copying and pasting changes back and forth.

I think this is an issue because the NPM Scripts are running as a Task, and tasks are terminated when reloading the window. If I open a terminal and manually type in `npm run serve`, it is persisted. But if I run it from the NPM Scripts view, it terminates on reload. 

Clicking the start button in this view is the issue. This might be an issue with all Tasks and not just terminal.

The current kernel is Python 3. However as soon as I execute any code, we create a connection to the remote jupyter server (this is in our remote case) and the kernel is now a 'live' kernel (the first kernel in the list. It is based on the Python 3 kernel but is now running)

Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

From the source control menu pick ""clone"".
Fill in a respository to clone (https://github.com/anj1/ThinPlateSplines.jl.git).
Select Repository Location dialog comes up.  Most of the line are in a grey that is barely distinguishable from the white background.  See attached screenshot.

The entries in light grey are all files, as opposed to directories, and so I guess they are irrelevant to picking a directory.  If so, why not exclude them entirely?  As it stands, they take up space and, potentially, time if one tries to figure out what they are.  If you don't want to drop them, please make the legible.  

Running under KDE on Debian/buster.

I am not entirely sure what component is responsible for the dialog: base VS Code, the base support for git in VSCode, or the GitLens extension.

**Suggestion**
* Please can we re-visit this issue
* Is it possible to provide some way for the Notebook to override the preferred renderer based on the content?

1. Upgrade to VSCode 1.54.1 from 1.53
2. A few of our extensions are failing to start because spawned shell script processes do not work

<!-- 🔧 Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->
Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: No

We run a few extensions (including an LSP server) which essentially spawn an external process executing shell wrapper scripts and attempts to manipulate its standard IO.

Since upgrading to 1.54.1 we have noticed a strange behavior where when writing to the external process stdin we get `EBADF` error. This seems specifically to only occur when attempting to execute shell script directly as when we modify the spawn (or similar functions) to invoke the script via `bash` directly it works fine.

This is illustrated by the following test cases executed while debugging VSCode:

```
> cp.execFile(""cat"", ['-'], options, cb).stdin.write(""foo\n"")
true
> cp.execFile(""scripts/bin/wrapper.sh"", [""cat"", ""-""], options, cb).stdin.write(""foo\n"")
Uncaught Error: write EBADF
> cp.execFile(""bash"", [""scripts/bin/wrapper.sh"", ""cat"", ""-""], options, cb).stdin.write(""foo\n"")
true
```
Where `wrapper.sh` ultimately will `exec` the rest of the command line.

118240,OPEN,On macOS; middle click selection paste should work in VSCode's integrated terminal to match macOS's standard Terminal,feature-request; integrated-terminal,2021-03-05 22:30:48 +0000 UTC,davidbsaltzman,,"Issue Type: <b>Feature Request</b>

I've been loving the convenience of VSCode's built-in terminal, but I keep trying to select text and middle-click-paste like I'm used to on Mac's standard Terminal app (out of habit and since it's often useful), but it doesn't work.

It would be great it middle click selection paste were implemented in VSCode's integrated terminal on Mac. a) for consistency with the standard standalone Mac Terminal app, and b) because it's a useful feature that speeds up a lot of tasks.

Also note that middle click selection paste doesn't go through the usual cmd+c/cmd+v clipboard; it's valuable that it doesn't overwrite that. Also note that unlike Linux, on Mac middle click selection paste is a terminal-specific feature, not an OS-wide feature. So for consistency with general Mac patterns, ideally this would be enabled in the integrated terminal but not in the text editor.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Delete the `editable` metadata property on all notebook cells so that they take on the notebook default.
2. Set the `cellEditable` metadata property on the notebook to `false`, indicating that cells should not be editable if their `editable` metadata property is not set.

Expected:
Cell not editable.

Actual:
Cell editable.

Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

I'm unsure if this is an NVDA or a Vs Code bug, so have also cross-posted in nvaccess/nvda#12125

1. Copy the contents of [crash.txt](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/files/6089611/crash.txt) into a new document in Vs Code
2. With NVDA running, press ctrl+end to go to the bottom, and press up arrow to read upwards.

Expected: it says `}`, as that is the end of the JSON output.

Actual: it read some data that belongs to lines further up. I think this is caused by that underlying chromium bug that prevents long files from being read properly.

More critically, it causes Vs Code to hang and NVDA to also hang as well. The only way to recover is to force kill Vs Code, which could be difficult if NVDA hangs as well.

When the terminal show syntax error, the ctrl+click on file link WON'T navi to the error line inside Editor when project path includes ""space"" char, it behaviors as two unexpected cases:

Steps to Reproduce: 

3 test cases.

Test #1 project path without space char.   - OK

 - c:/Users/garyzhao/test_vscode/a.py
 - put a syntax error like prxxxint(""hello"")
 - The terminal works fine, and ctrl+click on the file link successfully navi to the error line in editor.
 - when mouse hover on the file, it tips with ""open with editor"" as expected.

Test #2 project path with space char        -NOK

 - c:/Users/garyzhao/AAA BBB/test_vscode/a.py
 - Run same code as above
 - The terminal ctrl+click NOT able to navi to the editor
 - When mouse hover on the file link, the ""c:/Users/garyzhao/AAA BBB/test_vscode/a.py"" is split as two links: ""c:/Users/garyzhao/AAA"" and ""BBB/test_vscode/a.py"", mouse hover has NO any tips,  ctrl+click jump to the top input dialogue show ""no matching""

Test #3 project path put into One-Drive folder (with default space char)        -NOK

 - C:\Users\garyzhao\OneDrive - gary\test_vscode/a.py
 - Run same code as above
 - The terminal ctrl+click always open a new vscode window, this is NOT expected
 - When mouse hover on the file link, it tips with ""open with new windows"" always.

The workaround can be:

 - Not put the project in the default ""OneDrive - xxx"" folder
 - Not put the project in folder with ""space"" char
 - Put the project in a folder without ""space"" char.

I'm opening this as a tracking type bug. My `vscode-typescript` temporary files are still not *reliably* being deleted despite the change in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/73801

I strongly suspect this is because of an almost universally common mistake seen in rimaf - almost nobody ever actually deletes files correctly on windows, it's not obvious at all how to do it correctly unless you know how the windows filesystem works inside the kernel - that I've already filed a bug for:
https://github.com/isaacs/rimraf/issues/226

**_Quiet Light_** does the best job of uniquely coloring `$VAR`, `$` `{ }`, and `[ ]`, and $VAR's within strings.

My suggestion is to update all supplied themes so color classes are applied consistently.  I am not aware
of the intricacies of colors, themes, and the affects of themes in multiple programming languates, and am raising the issue using bash as an example.



Steps to Reproduce:

1.  Edit any bash script
2.  Select one of the standard themes

## Environment data

-   VS Code version: 1.54.0-insider
-   Jupyter Extension version (available under the Extensions sidebar): 2021.3.619093157
-   Python Extension version (available under the Extensions sidebar): 2021.2.582707922
-   OS (Windows | Mac | Linux distro) and version: Windows 10 Pro (10.0.19041)
-   Python and/or Anaconda version: Python 3.7.6 64-bit
-   Type of virtual environment used (N/A | venv | virtualenv | conda | ...): N/A
-   Jupyter server running: Local 

## Expected behaviour
Having a vertical scrollbar in the Notebook Output Cells when contents exceed a certain value.
Related Jupyter settings are set:
 - Jupyter: Enable Scrolling For Cell Outputs (TRUE)
 - Jupyter: Max Output Size (100, Default was 200)

## Actual behaviour
Jupyter settings related to output cell scrolling seem to be ignored.
No scrollbar is added to a long output cell (must use the main scrollbar to scroll all the way down to the next input cell).

## Steps to reproduce:
INPUT:
for i in range(0.1000):
  print(i)

OUTPUT:
Values from 0 to 1000 printed to output, but without scrollbar in the output cell.
Results in an output that is over 4 pages long.
(Scrollbar visible in GIF is the main document scrollbar, what I want is an individual Output Cell scrollbar)

Thanks for filing this issue. Unfortunately the new Notebook in Insiders does't respect all of the settings. We'll try to get this functionality in.

Hello,
I was trying to edit my HTML page. I use Bootstrap 4 for styling. When I tried to replace a class named ""mr-40"" with a bootstrap class called ""mx-auto"". I found that when I tried to replace the texts they are replaced in capital letters, but it was supposed to be replaced in small letters because the class name is in small letters.
Steps I tried in VS Code given below;
Ctrl+F
Ctrl+H
Find - 'mr-40'
Replace with - 'mx-auto'
Result - 'mr-40' replaced with 'mx-AUTO'
Expected result - 'mr-40' replaced with 'mx-auto'
Expected all texts to be in small letters but the text after '-' is placed as capital letters.

I observed that it was happening to this particular class only.

Please help
Thanks

1. Open a JavaScript or TSX file and type <div property and type ` right after property attribute twice.
2. Or for example const Div = styled.div and two back ticks right after div. and you'll end up with three back ticks.

The annoying part is when there's 3 you HAVE to press the delete key to get rid of the 3rd one. If I press the back space it goes back to 1 tick (auto complete deletion).
This happens in javascript / babel Javascript files but not in HTML or Typescript files. Might happen in others but haven't checked yet.

I think one of the areas that could benefit from quicker tooltips/custom hovers is the activity bar as it is a frequently used area and the native tooltip takes too long to load. We've seen this in user studies where new users are not sure what these items are and don't click on them.

`code workspace someName`

Which will then create someName.code-workspace in the current directory and it will then open said workspace in VS Code. Like usual, someName.code-workspace will contain the following:

```
{
	""folders"": [
		{
			""path"": "".""
		}
	],
	""settings"": {}
}
```

Perhaps one could set the path like so:

`code workspace /home/username/MyProject/someName`

Which would then create the workspace file in the MyProject directory, of course. This for cases where you're not actually in the project directory when running the command.

Other ideas and possible formats:

`code create workspace someName` (a bit more verbose, versus `code workspace someName`)
or
`code create workspace`, (no file name) the user is then prompted to give the code-workspace a file name.

Like I said, it's just an idea to address a very minor inconvenience, admittedly and one that I'll most likely implement myself, using another means but, thought I'd share, just the same.

That way VS Code can ask the user when one of these default extensions is installed when opening a supported file whether it would like to be the default (eg. Luna Paint), but not for ""secondary"" custom editors where that doesn't make as much sense (eg. Hex Editor).

1. open a search editor, do a search & let it finish
2. do another search, but before it finishes switch to another tab (or open a new file)
3. switch back to the search editor

There are several issues, as demonstrated in the demo below.
1. when entering the search query `maven`, the name of the search editor's tab isn't updated
2. when switching to another tab, the blue bar keeps running, which gives the impression that the search is continuing in the background
3. when switching back to the search editor eventually, the search query has reverted to the original value
4. also, even after switching back, the blue bar still keeps running, and it takes a long time before it disappears & the user realises that their search query hasn't executed

118004,OPEN,Bash variable substitution using VS Code variable lead to no substitution,bug; variable-resolving,2021-03-25 14:08:19 +0000 UTC,moocan,,"
Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create simple task with as command in task.json (unquoted or quoted):
Unquoted: `""command"":  ""shopt -s globstar; for prjfile in ${workspaceFolder}/**/*; do echo ${workspaceFolder}; echo ${prjfile//${workspaceFolder}/.}; done""`
Quoted `""command"":  ""shopt -s globstar; for prjfile in \""${workspaceFolder}\""/**/*; do echo \""${workspaceFolder}\""; echo \""${prjfile//\""${workspaceFolder}\""/.}\""; done""`
2. Execute task
3. Variable substitution `${prjfile//${workspaceFolder}/.}` is not made when you call `${workspaceFolder}` directly in the substitution or using a VisualStudio Code variables as `${workspaceRoot}` too.

Launching task but no substitution:
`> Executing task: shopt -s globstar; prjFolder=/myfolder/project-test; for prjfile in /myfolder/project-test/**/*; do echo /myfolder/project-test; echo ${prjfile//${workspaceFolder}/.}; done <`

Testing directly with `bash -c ""shopt -s globstar; workspaceFolder=""myfolder""; for prjfile in \""\${workspaceFolder}\""/**/*; do echo \""\${workspaceFolder}\""; echo \""\${prjfile//\""\${workspaceFolder}\""/.}\""; done""` is working

Working: 
Use of `${workspaceFolder}` for the for loop and echoing it's value and using another variable for substitution.

Unquoted : 
`""shopt -s globstar; prjFolder=${workspaceFolder}; for prjfile in ${workspaceFolder}/**/*; do echo ${workspaceFolder}; echo ${prjfile//${prjFolder}/.}; done""`
Quoted 
`""shopt -s globstar; prjFolder=\""${workspaceFolder}\""; for prjfile in \""${workspaceFolder}\""/**/*; do echo \""${workspaceFolder}\""; echo \""${prjfile//\""${prjFolder}\""/.}\""; done""`

Launching task and substitution is done:
`> Executing task: shopt -s globstar; prjFolder=/myfolder/project-test; for prjfile in /myfolder/project-test/**/*; do echo /myfolder/project-test; echo ${prjfile//${prjFolder}/.}; done <`

Working: 
Set the content of `${workspaceFolder}` to `prjFolder` and then use only this variable 
for all other steps.

Unquoted : 
`""shopt -s globstar; prjFolder=${workspaceFolder}; for prjfile in ${prjFolder}/**/*; do echo ${workspaceFolder}; echo ${prjfile//${prjFolder}/.}; done""`
Quoted : 
`""shopt -s globstar; prjFolder=\""${workspaceFolder}\""; for prjfile in \""${prjFolder}\""/**/*; do echo \""${workspaceFolder}\""; echo \""${prjfile//\""${prjFolder}\""/.}\""; done""`

Launching task and substitution is done:

Zen mode with centre layout doesn't work with multiple tab groups.

This is understandable when the split is vertical (left/right), but it should be possible with a horizontal split (up/down).
This would be very useful when working with test scripts that define a large array of tests in one section, and then execute those tests in another section using a loop.

I found https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/94574 which seems to have prevented centre layout from working if there are more than one tab groups, regardless of the relative position/location of those tab groups.

We could further:

- [ ] Move all publishing to the [Release job](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/build/azure-pipelines/release.yml). It can simply download the builds as artifacts and upload them to Azure Storage and Mooncake and update CosmosDB. With this we can shave some seconds off each platform agent, since they wouldn't reach out to Azure Storage or CosmosDB.
- [ ] Remove all CosmosDB stored procedures in use. They were introduced due to issues surrounding concurrent writes to CosmosDB from multiple clients. Since we'd have a single client, this would be straightforward.

Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

Steps to reproduce are only for touch screen laptop. This issue happens only with touch screen keyboard in touch screen laptop.

1: Start writing a progam. Eventually you'll end up requiring to use the 'Shift' key.
2: Now switch to another application like chrome by clicking on the app icon in the taskbar. This happens sometimes without switching apps also.
3: You may notice if you type in search bar, all input will be capitalized as if 'Shift' was held down. Clicking on any other application opens up a new window.

PS: My hotkeys are turned off.

I have to restart my PC everytime  this happens. And it happens quite frequently (every 15 mins).
I have a major disability and use a [mouthstick](https://www.google.com/search?q=mouth+stick+stylus&safe=off&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIN914IN914&sxsrf=ALeKk005A0jE1dKxSj5R64Kz1d-3lQvYdw:1614599351093&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjZzpqmg4_vAhXJc30KHaqaCOoQ_AUoAnoECAIQBA&biw=1094&bih=446&dpr=1.25#imgrc=TZ-xVXugO6O9yM) to use my laptop and work as a full stack engineer. This issue has been quite disturbing for past 1-2 months. I really would appreciate and mean a lot if someone suggest a solution. VsCode is the only thing that allowed me to do programming as it supported most of my accessibility isssues like touch navigation and with some workarounds allows me to do my job.

### Problem description:
Disabling the setting ""_Copy With Syntax Highlighting_"" (ie setting ""**editor.copyWithSyntaxHighlighting**"": **false**) does not work properly. I expect that having disabled this setting, anything I copy (using regular **Ctrl+C**) from the editor should be in pure plain text format. But my tests show that not to be the case. I had problems pasting the text in an online word document, edited in the Chrome browser. The text gets pasted with a bold format. If I paste it into notepad, then copying that text, then the text is clean when pasted into word.

Using the windows program **ClipView**, that shows technical details about the current clipboard content, I was able to identify the problem. When copying text in Visual Studio Code, even with ""editor.copyWithSyntaxHighlighting"": false, it adds a clipboard format called ""**Chromium Web Custom MIME Data Format**"". If I copy text from notepad this ""Chromium Web Custom MIME Data Format"" is not included. And some programs, like the Word web editor in Chrome it seems, sees this format and decides ""this text should have a bold format!"".

### Steps to reproduce:
1. Open Visual Studio Code with all extensions disabled
2. Write some text in some plain text format, select the text, and copy it using Ctrl+C
3. Inspect the clipboard content using ClipView (or some similar program)

### Expected result:
* Only regular plain text clipboard formats should be seen

### Actual result:
* A clipboard format called ""Chromium Web Custom MIME Data Format"" is included

I see this as a bug. With the setting ""editor.copyWithSyntaxHighlighting"": false, any copied text should be pure plain text in the clipboard, and nothing else. So the clipboard format called ""Chromium Web Custom MIME Data Format"" should be removed.

* [x] there is duplicated logic for when a file is being deleted, e.g text file editors have [`inOrphanMode`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/509cd79dbd636b198c1e21ebe3059256262ebe4d/src/vs/workbench/services/textfile/common/textFileEditorModel.ts#L124-L124) and custom editors have [`_inOrphaned`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/f3f4eebecbd47df5012d773fcfcadc4e65fbe79b/src/vs/workbench/api/browser/mainThreadCustomEditors.ts#L407-L407). There is a utility method [`decorateFileEditorLabel`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/9f7d229461a3af85a6977b842cd0445ad9396f19/src/vs/workbench/contrib/files/common/editors/fileEditorInput.ts#L391-L391) to decorate the editor label to indicate orphaned editors but this should move into a common super type. Notebooks didn't copy this yet. Again, I should be able to express to the framework that I am some kind of file editor and then deletion should be taken care of
* [x] the logic for general file watching is duplicated, e.g when a file on disk changes we reload it unless the file is dirty ([text files](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/277c60fc0a20ee56c6ed83041434a1f136a6cb99/src/vs/workbench/services/textfile/common/textFileEditorModelManager.ts#L111-L111), [notebooks](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/65e283212409e65a7c90b59831d671b7dd2ded9b/src/vs/workbench/contrib/notebook/common/notebookEditorModel.ts#L81-L81)). The framework should do that automatically because I already tell it how to load and whether my model is dirty or not.
* [ ] there is a [`TextFileEditorTracker`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/277c60fc0a20ee56c6ed83041434a1f136a6cb99/src/vs/workbench/contrib/files/browser/editors/textFileEditorTracker.ts#L18-L18) that takes care of opening dirty models and reloading them when the window gains focus but this code is only used for text file models. Notebooks has [`NotebookFileTracker`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/c13b21f7f8cc7d976fda541a03752f31426b4fe6/src/vs/workbench/contrib/notebook/browser/notebook.contribution.ts#L713-L713) for that
* [x] there is a complex dirty write prevention code in file service [validateWriteFile](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/cda3b7e157fe0cbd0dfad66a30aa3cbd2ddd1e47/src/vs/platform/files/common/fileService.ts#L394-L414) . A simple version was implemented in notebook but it has ""false negative"" bugs as remote/live-share cases are not covered. Custom editor doesn't handle this yet it seems. Related: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/117715
* [x] text file models [register listeners](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/1a6f64ef1ded53eef9df0d9f3410a9f8f5914f52/src/vs/workbench/services/textfile/electron-browser/nativeTextFileService.ts#L75-L77) to gracefully finish any pending saves on shutdown, which notebooks and custom editors either do not do or currently fail to do with a high risk of data loss

I don't think this list is complete but that's my learning from the little exposure I have gotten via the notebook world. The current approach just seems wasteful: we duplicate code, we duplicate bugs, we duplicate work. ",,
118973,OPEN,Symlinked home path causes aliasing files to be considered different,integrated-terminal; integrated-terminal-links,2021-03-30 21:06:43 +0000 UTC,upsj,,"
Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

I am working on an HPC system where /home is symlinked to another path /some/other/path, which seems to cause some issues:

Having opened /home/some/user/path as a folder, VSCode seems to inconsistently follow the symlink, as the reported absolute path for files is /home/some/user/path, but when I Ctrl+click a relative path in the terminal (where the `pwd` output prints the /home path), the corresponding file in /some/other/path gets opened, which causes issues, since I now have the same file open under two different paths, and the two don't get synchronized.

I am not 100% sure whether I should report this issue on VSCode directly or here, since it seems to be related to file handling in general. An obvious workaround is to use the non-symlinked path to open the folder in VSCode, but this still points to a more fundamental issue.

Let me know if you need any additional information to reproduce this issue.

The same happens with other codicons that support the spin modifier (e.g., `gear~spin`). The `div` that the spin modifier is applied to, doesn't have its `width` and `height` fixed and includes a `padding-right` of `6px` which seems to cause this off-center rotation:

117789,OPEN,VS Code doesn't display error response from invalid exception filter conditions,debug; feature-request,2021-03-22 13:28:02 +0000 UTC,gregg-miskelly,,"
Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

1. Configure an exception filter with an invalid condition. In my case, I am using an experimental version of the C# debugger, and I used the bogus coniditon of '==Bogus'
2. Start debugging

Expected:
VS Code should somehow tell me that I entered an invalid exception filter by displaying the text from the error response as the DAP spec indicates. My suggestion would be a warning icon next to the exception filters and display the error message as a notification.

Actual:
The error response isn't displayed anywhere.

Here is a partial protocol trace:
```
-> {""command"":""setExceptionBreakpoints"",""arguments"":{""filters"":[],""filterOptions"":[{""filterId"":""all"",""condition"":""==Bogus""},{""filterId"":""user-unhandled""}]},""type"":""request"",""seq"":5}
<- {""seq"":10,""type"":""response"",""request_seq"":5,""success"":false,""command"":""setExceptionBreakpoints"",""message"":""Syntax error in condition for 'All Exceptions'. Unexpected character near column 0 (character '=').""}

From experimenting, seems like configs are only checked in compounds when the file opens, and not when it changes.

Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#SourceControl says of the optional `count` property:
> Equals to the total number of resource state of this source control, if undefined.

I'm finding that this doesn't happen. To reproduce:

1. Set `""scm.providerCountBadge"": ""visible""`
2. Clone https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples
3. Open the source-control-sample folder, build it (`npm install`) and run it (`F5`)
4. Switch to SCM view and see that the (0) badge appears on the provider line (JSFiddle #demo)
5. Change one of the demo documents, save the change, and confirm that the (1) badge appears on the Changes group and on the provider.
6. Close the Extension Development Host window.
7. In the extension sample source, openfiddleSourceControl.ts and comment out this line:
```ts
 this.jsFiddleScm.count = this.changedResources.resourceStates.length;
```
8. Run the test again. :bug: the provider line count remains zero even when a change is made to a demo file.

This is not a 1.54 regression; it also exists in 1.53

1. Open a folder as a workspace.
2. Press CMD+Shift+E or CTRL+Shift+E to focus on explorer and choose a file.
3. Press your context menu key.
4. Arrow through the menu, then decide you don't want to select an item, and press Escape.

Result: In some cases, focus position is lost, and keyboard focus is not on the file you were on before.

This worked in 1.53.

I find that I always have trouble understanding how folding works. Here are a few notes on what confused me:

- The fold indicators on all the cells have the same indentation.
 
    To me, it look like all the cells are at the same level, but really folding `verification` folds the `verifiable ...` and `unreleased ...` cells too. Is there some way we could express the hierarchy better?

- There is no preview of what will be folded.

    For code, the indent guides sort of offer a preview of the range that will be folded. When you hover over a fold indicator,  could we preview the range of cells that will be folded?

- It is easy to miss that a cell has been folded

    In code, we have both line numbers and the folding highlighting that makes folded regions more obvious

Thanks to the team to provide a centralized contribution point for the `run` button. Here are some feedback for consideration.

- Show the keyboard shortcut in the dropdown menu?
- Considering another entry for `debug` (editor/title/debug)? In that case the user can just have one click if each contribution(run and debug) just has one entry.
- Just like what we have in the debug view, the title area can have a dropdown menu explicitly and VS Code can memorize the last choice. (But given the very limited area there, this might not be a good idea though)

It would be nice if the new jupyter native notebooks either compressed the dataframe column display width by default, or had an option to do so.

When tables have few/narrow columns the display would look better similar to the `rendered html` image below:

I've tried with the `pandas.display` settings like `max_colwidth` but those don't seem to have an effect on the display output.

There are some Git commands which are specific to the current open file, e.g.:
- ""Git: Rename""
- ""Git: Add to .gitignore""
- ""Git: Open File""
- ""Git: Open File (HEAD)""
- ""Git: Initialize Repository"" (not directly related to open file, but still misleading)

The issue is that these commands also appear when opening a single separate file from outside the repository.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a folder `somefolder`
2. Initialize a Git repository (from VSCode or command line)
3. Open the folder in VSCode
4. Create a file `outside.txt` somewhere outside that folder
5. Open the file in VSCode (through ""File"" > ""Open File..."")

The ""Git: Rename"" command added by #97486 apparently performs some file path resolving which can mess up the result file paths, either adding an additional drive letter prefix in front, or adding parent directory references (`\..`) before the drive letter.
In my case I have a `C:` drive containing the Windows and program installations, and a `D:` drive.
1. Open a folder on the `D:` drive in VSCode, e.g. `D:\somefolder\`
2. Create a file in that folder (either from VSCode or Windows Explorer)
3. Create a Git repository (either from VSCode or the command line)
4. Select command ""Git: Rename""
ℹ️ Here it already uses an invalid path in the edit text field: `C:\d:\somefolder\test.txt` (note the leading `C:\`)
5. Replace the suggested file name with the correct `D:\somefolder\new_test.txt` and perform the rename
:x: It fails, the Git log shows:
    ```
    > git mv C:\d:\somefolder\test.txt D:\somefolder\new_test.txt
    fatal: Invalid path 'C:/d:': No such file or directory

When I instead create the folder `C:\Users\Someone\Downloads\test` and then repeat the steps, I get this error:
```

117700,OPEN,Task cwd not correct in multi-root workspace,bug; tasks,2021-03-15 10:12:18 +0000 UTC,hhanesand,,"Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

Hello,

I've set up a task that builds the current pacakge the user has open in a multi-root workspace. I'm trying to set the task cwd, but it doesn't get the correct value.

task definition, inside `.code-workspace`:
```
{
    ""label"": ""build active package"",
    ""type"": ""shell"",
    ""command"": ""${fileWorkspaceFolder}${pathSeparator}..${pathSeparator}..${pathSeparator}scripts${pathSeparator}run-rush-command.sh -c build"",
    ""options"": {
        ""cwd"": ""${fileWorkspaceFolder}""
    },
    ""problemMatcher"": [
        ""$tsc""
    ],
    ""dependsOn"": [
        ""setup""
    ],
    ""presentation"": {
        ""reveal"": ""always"",
        ""focus"": true,
        ""panel"": ""shared"",
        ""showReuseMessage"": true,
        ""clear"": false
    }
},
```

When I run the command, I get the following:
```
> Executing task in folder different-pacakge-name: ~/Developer/repo-name/packages/correct-package-name/../../scripts/run-rush-command.sh -c build <
```

As we can see in the `command` definition, I'm specifying `${fileWorkspaceFolder}`, which is correctly aliased to ` ~/Developer/repo-name/packages/correct-package-name`, but the task is run in an incorrect folder `different-pacakge-name`.

This causes the $tsc matcher to generate the wrong path, which mean's we're unable to click on the issue to open the file with the issue. `$tsc` thinks the file path is `~/Developer/repo-name/packages/different-pacakge-name/file-path.ts`. 

`different-pacakge-name` is coincidentally the alphabetically first root in the multi-root workspace. The same `different-pacakge-name` is used no matter what file I run the task from.

Have I messed something up here?

117644,OPEN,Sluggish scrolling in notebook windows,freeze-slow-crash-leak; needs more info; notebook,2021-03-27 11:52:47 +0000 UTC,DavidKutu,,"@oscarrutt commented on [Mon Feb 22 2021](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/4904)

Scrolling in Jupyter notebook windows is sluggish, laggy, and jumpy. It's not horrible but it is bad enough to cause stress, aggravation, and fatigue. Scrolling is nowhere as nice as in other applications when you get that ""massless"" feeling. JupyterLab in Firefox is an example of a Jupyter notebook that runs in a cross-platform environment that scrolls nearly perfectly. The problem appears when scrolling with either two-finger drag on the trackpad or click-dragging the thumb bar in the elevator region.

My computer runs macOS 10.11.6. This is an older version of the OS but it should have no effect on scrolling since all other apps scroll well.

I'm using Jupyter in VSCode Insiders to write Julia. I don't know if the problem extends to non-Julia notebooks.

@oscarrutt and @jaymegordo, does this only happen with native notebooks? Does it happen say, on a regular python file in vs code?

@jaymegordo commented on [Wed Feb 24 2021](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/4904#issuecomment-785414412)

@DavidKutu I remember really noticing jittery/slow scrolling when I switched from ""old notebooks"" to native notebooks a few moths ago. In a standard large python file I can scroll top-bottom in a fraction of a second, but in a NN there's definitely a bit more resistence. I assume this is probably just related to rendering all the extra assets (tables/charts etc). I _think_ the NN scrolling has improved since I first started using it, but I cant actually compare to the old notebooks right now because they don't even work in my stable vscode (I think its something related to ""experimental"" settings, haven't had time or need to make it work). Its not horrible, just makes me a bit more hesitant to want to scroll around quickly.

So in summary, NN scrolling is definitely slower than a regular python file, but could just be the extra stuff to render. If I can get my old notebooks working I'll try and give a side by side comparison.

@oscarrutt commented on [Wed Feb 24 2021](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter/issues/4904#issuecomment-785417651)

@DavidKutu It does not happen with a regular Python file. As far as I can tell it does not happen with any text file in either vsc or vsc-i.

But to be clear, as far as I can tell, _no_ text file in either vsc or vsc-i scrolls as well as in a native Mac app. One does not have to look far: TextEdit, XCode, or even the Quick Look window in Finder. It's just that the problem as reported here is past the point of acceptability IMO.

I can (now!) open Julia native notebooks in vsc. (I thought that wasn't possible a week ago. Am I confused? The display is different, with different backgrounds and widgets but no syntax coloring in vsc.) In any case, my Julia native notebooks seem to scroll as well in vsc as text scrolls in vsc. Hope this isn't too confusing.

When you install Visual Studio Code, in the last step, it allows you to add it to various menus, and also to add it to the system path. It says that if you add it to the system path, the shell will have to be restarted for it to take effect.

This is not the case. Instead, you only need to send a WM_SETTINGCHANGE message to all windows using HWND_BROADCAST. When the shell receives that message, it reloads the environment.

117608,OPEN,Word wrap wraps too early when not rendering control characters,feature-request; polish,2021-02-24 17:46:37 +0000 UTC,rzhao271,,"Testing #112382

I copy-pasted the ACK character, and then started pasting it into the editor.
Word wrap is on, rendering control characters is off, and I notice that the ACKs wrap too early. Both wrapping strategies produce the same result.

Here's a screenshot from the current Insiders on Codespaces:

117606,OPEN,[Live Share Web] File Explorer doesn't auto-update on adding a file or folder,,2021-03-08 16:00:28 +0000 UTC,jramsay,,"
This is an issue specific to **VS Code Online** so it only repros in **Live Share Web** and not in our desktop extension

Issue: when the Live Share host (on VS Code desktop) adds a file or folder, the guest on _Live Share Web_ does not see it until they manually click the ""Refresh Explorer"" button. It worth noting the issue appears to be specific to add. File or folder rename and delete work correctly - the File Explorer updates automatically and no manual refresh is required.

Our Live Share Web extension has a WorkspaceFileSystemProvider that extends vscode.FileSystemProvider. I've debugged this and can see that when the host adds, deletes, or renames an item, Live Share's file service sends an event that fires **onDidChangeFile.**:

public readonly onDidChangeFile: vscode.Event<vscode.FileChangeEvent[]> = this.onFilesChangedEmitter.event;

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8161247/109036341-5b05dd80-767e-11eb-9261-8eb32d2716a7.png)

I'm not seeing any of the FileSystemProvider methods get called after the add event fires (Stat, readFile, readDirectory, etc)

I'm unable to debug VS Code minified as for some reason Pretty Print workbench.web.api.js doesn't work anymore on Chrome or Edge (known issue?). I've taken a look at the callstack for Rename events that do refresh correctly and I can see our FileSystemProvider's Stat() gets called from this call stack - so I'm presuming it is going wrong somewhere here for the add event:

Steps to Reproduce:


1. Host on VS Code Desktop: Sign in and start a Live Share session 

2. Guest: Copy the session link directly to Chrome/Edge Chromium browser to join this session with MSA/GitHub accounts.

3. Host: Add a file or folder

Expected: 

The file tree should be refreshed automatically on the guest side

Actual:

The file tree will update only when refresh it manually

Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

I am currently using Windows 10 and this started a couple of months ago, but this week, it has become unbearable. The White lines merely used to occlude my file explorer in my workspace, it was annoying and made reading names of files almost impossible, but it was still ok. this week was a new low even for this White line issue. Nhow it started intruding upon my code space, causing even greater issues while I am coding as well, I am not sure what could possibly fix this issue. I can only state that this issue also exists in the epic games launcher.

I am guessing this is an issue with the underlying JS framework and the graphics pipeline of my system not really working together properly. 

I am currently using a laptop with integrated and a discrete gpu. This problem is perisistent on windows 10.

The Atom code editor that also works on the same Electron JS framework does not have this issue. I have tried setting the global settings for the gpu being used to automatic and I have tried all the possible fixes listed online, but none have really worked for me.

I added the following three providers: one which does case-sensitive local variable lookups, another which finds global variables (case-insensitive) and provides text saying it's global, and another one which finds local variables (case-insensitive) and provides text saying it's local. All three use the range provided in the repo: 
`const rng = new vscode.Range(l, m.index, l, m.index + varName.length);`

Here's an example of the result. I'm not sure if this is the expected sort behaviour.
For example, if we're going by columns, it should be `local_i` first.

So far, my understanding of `vscode.TestObserver` and its factory functions is that a test observer gives you access to tests, e.g it enumerates them and fires events when something changes. The usual API pattern for something like that doesn't use such an indirection but exposes things directly. So, I wonder why there isn't something like this instead

117358,OPEN,Support reason for why accessing auth,feature-request,2021-02-23 17:49:35 +0000 UTC,jrieken,,"Testing #117290

I really like the new ""silent"" auth flow.  I think having a reason property on the getSession-options could make this even better as it would allow extensions to explain why they need auth-access. E.g in the screen shot below we could render a message from my extension so that users feel informed.

Checkout the confusing screen capture below. For testing #117290 I have renamed my extension from `test-secrets` to `test-secrets2` (only id, not display name and hence the funny screen shot). The problem is that the auth logic still knows about the `test-secrets` extension although it doesn't exist anymore. I would assume the same happens in the real world when uninstalling an extension and IMO the auth-data should then be dropped

117269,OPEN,Can't start extension host process from duplicate workspace windows,,2021-03-25 21:14:07 +0000 UTC,Tpuljak,,"
1. Open a workspace containing an extension in development (Let's call it `workspace  A`).
2. Duplicate the workspace (Command Palette -> Workspaces: Duplicate as Workspace in New Window) (call this `workspace B`)
3. Run the extension from `workspace A`. This opens a new VSCode window that runs the Extension and `workspace A` is debugging it.
4. Run the extension from `workspace B`. This uses the same VSCode window that `workspace A` used and shuts down the `workspace A` debug process. **(Previously `workspace B` would open its own new VSCode instance so the processes would run in parallel in `workspace A` and `workspace B`)**

I've been developing an extension for the last couple of months and it was very important for me to be able to run parallel extension host processes so they can communicate with each other.

I took a break from developing it since Jan 19th 2021 and returned to it today and discovered this issue. (In the meantime VSCode updated to version 1.53.2 so I presume the issue came with the changes applied with that version)

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open the file with the extension sass.
2. Enter the abbreviation to perform the expansion.
3. The first deployment will be performed, but after the second deployment, the error ""Failed to expand addreviation"" will always occur and the deployment cannot be executed.
4. Regardless of the content of the abbreviation, an error will always occur in the second and subsequent expansions.
5. As long as I'm running VS Code, I keep getting errors.

```
	""test"": {
		""prefix"": ""tt"",

			""$1 -> ${1/(.*)/${1:/upcase}/}""

## Actual
If I use this snippet after type some text it will convert to uppercase on the right side
But if I insert some variable through intellisense in snippet it stays the same lowercased on the right side

## Expected
Inserted value should be transformed despite the method the text was inserted

I would think that a better place for this would be `IEditorService#createEditorInput` and the backup restorer should just use that. If we need to make this method async for a few usecases I think that is OK, as long as the signature could stay sync for most typical uses.

In https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/116856 I have moved the handling of `workbench.editorAssociations` into `vs/workbench/browser/editor.ts` as an editor associations factory because I felt the editor service was the wrong place for it. 

However, if the only client of this setting is the custom editor service, I would suggest to move it somewhere there. And if not, I would suggest to move code of custom editor handling into workbench core. Specifically `CustomEditorInfo` and `selectorMatches` etc.

I think my preference would be to move the factory code into the custom editor contrib and let notebooks use it from there. If you feel strong about moving it back into a service, feel free to add it to custom editor service.

### Root-cause analysis
The problem is that the invalid file got downloaded and kept in place. I found file `c:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Code\CachedExtensionVSIXs\ms-python.python-2021.2.582707922` with the following content:

```html
<html>
<body onload=""document.forms[0].submit()"">
<noscript>
<p>        You will be redirected to a ....
        </p>
</noscript>
<form action=""..."" method=""post"">
<input type=""hidden"" name=""RelayState"" value=""...""/>
<input type=""hidden"" ... value=""...""/>
<noscript>
<input type=""submit"" value=""Continue""/>
</noscript>
</form>
</body>
</html>
````  

This file was re-used while retrying to update the extension. Even after uninstalling and trying to install the extension again the problem persisted.

Invalid downloaded files could be kept after download for investigation, but they should be re-downloaded when trying to update again. Solution could be to rename the downloaded file to something else (add “corrupted” prefix/suffix) when corruption is detected for example.

I can manage to match the first line, maybe the second. I would probably be able to do something, if these had a fixed line count, but they don't.

I tried to use the `loop` flag, but it only seems to work for a style where the first line has the location followed by one line messages/line/character matches.

I think this would be popular with other languages too, I briefly looked at the `rust-analyzer` vscode extension, as rust also has multiline error messages. But they also don't seem to have a working matcher.

Iam aware, that this could be augmented via the language server instead in some way. But I hoped to first tackle this in a simpler way.

Interestingly this issue started to appear at more recent builds, possibly since the Electron update (or possibly just before). Code has been used on the same rig at 110% scaling April-December 2020 without any issue.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Set a custom scaling of 110% (in Win10 Display.. scale and layout.. advanced scaling settings), and/or set window.zoomLevel to (say) 0.3
2. Scroll to different parts of a document and interact with text via mouse clicks, selection or typing
3. Observe that when beginning to type or move the caret with LR cursor keys, the current text line may move up or down by a pixel. Moving UD with cursor keys results in the same movement on the line being moved to.
4. Possibly related, doing a column select reveals inconsistent inter-line gaps, consistent at normal scaling

I searched for issues related to large files but they all seem to imply that the issues were fixed a long time ago and that loading large files *should* work fine today.  Once the file is loaded, everything is snappy **except** resizing the window.  Any attempt to resize the VS Code window will result in an even longer wait time than the initial load.

117070,OPEN,Fix and consider using the terminal's latency detection code,feature-request; integrated-terminal,2021-02-19 18:06:46 +0000 UTC,Tyriar,,"There is some code in the terminal to enable getting the latency each terminal instance, eg:

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/bd00c624a88bed30444bdae4cc6cecc7be87a50a/src/vs/platform/terminal/node/terminalProcess.ts#L414-L416

The idea here was to measure the time it took to call `getLatency` which itself is a very simple function on `TerminalProcess` that simple returns 0, such that getLatency requests for processes local to the renderer process would simply be 0. This could then feed into type ahead and other features as necessary. So this would measure the latency between the renderer and the TerminalProcess object, not the actual pty.

@TylerLeonhardt, @connor4312 not sure if this is of use in type ahead now but it might be a useful signal.",,

Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

1. Merge something with more than 5000 changed files
2. Have merge conflicts in several files, including files not in the first 5000 changed files
3. VS Code only shows the ones in the first 5000 changed files

The preferred behaviour would be that VS Code shows all conflicts, probably by reducing the number of viewed staged changes

# Steps to Reproduce


 - Windows Key + . (period) => Opens up the emoji panel
 - Writing anything while the panel is showing searches an emoji that matches the text that is being written.
 - The emoji panel reacts correctly to whatever emoji we search for but the search text being written doesn't show up like it used to before.
 - It used to show up covered in a highlighted way so it is distinct from other letters that doesn't come under the emoji search query.
 ---
 -  This stopped working after the recent updates.
 - Writing anything does not show up while the emoji panel is on.
 - Disabling all the extensions does not help the problem.
 - This was not a problem on earlier versions.
 - I noticed it while putting emojis in the commit messages but it doesn't work on the normal code area either

It's important to not modify undo/redo, but add to it somehow..

Some UI ideas:

1. A shortcut that lets you cycle through branches and change file to match their leaf.

It was not published for 5 months (mid-September), while the LS received several updates in VSCode source tree and releases.
There are 2 issues:
* In vscode, the vscode-json-languageserver module version is more or less unmaintained. The vscode-json-languageserver is treated as an internal module so version concerns are secondary.
* When VSCode releases, no new release of vscode-json-languageserver seems to happen automatically.

That makes the npm module more or less useless: we tried to adopt it in Wild Web Developer and got missing features, or unexpected older dependencies, conflicting with other LS we ""extract"" from VSCode. As a result, we move back to extracting this JSON Language Server from VSCode.

I think it would be in the best interest of the LSP community if this language server were extracted from VSCode source tree as a standalone NPM module, with proper versioning and published to npm.js. Then consumers (VSCode, Wild Web Developer...) could just install this module with some guarantee of it being up-to-date.
Same pattern could apply to other LS and debug adapters included in VSCode (HTML, CSS).",,

### Problem

Imagine you're looking at some code in VS Code:

```
function transferBalance(sender_id, recipient_id, amount, currency) { ⋯ }

transferBalance(5678,‮6776,4321‬,""USD"");
```

Ostensibly, this transfers 6,776 USD from sender 5678 to recipient 1234. Right?

Unfortunately, no. Instead, this code hides malicious intent: **it actually transfers 4,321 USD from sender 5678 to recipient 6776**, stealing sender 5678's money. How is this possible?

### Explanation

It's because this code is hiding two special Unicode control characters: U+202E (""right-to-left override"") and U+202C (""pop directional formatting""). With explicit insertions, it looks like this:

```
                             malicious!
                             ▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼
transferBalance(5678,<U+202E>6776,4321<U+202C>,""USD"");
                     ▲▲▲▲▲▲▲▲         ▲▲▲▲▲▲▲▲
                     🕵sneaky!        🕵sneaky!
```

In other words, this gives the code the _visual appearance_ of sending 6776 USD to recipient 1234, but that's not what the _actual underlying text_ says; it says to transfer 4,321 USD to recipient 6776. Our editor — what we trust to show us text correctly — has led us into the wrong conclusion.

We can see that the actual bytes of the string in the code example do indeed have these control characters:

![Screenshot from 2021-02-18 06-07-48](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57813/108348375-b6802900-71af-11eb-8b08-7d27fa1d522f.png)

Normally the way around this sort of sneakiness is to use `View > Show Control Characters`. But if you copy the string from the example into VS Code, you won't see these control characters. They aren't rendered at all. How can we make sure these special characters get rendered?

### Likely root cause

The bug is in `src/vs/editor/common/viewLayout/viewLineRenderer.ts`: it assumes a definition of ""control character"" that amounts to ""anything whose character code as determined by [`String.charCodeAt`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/charCodeAt) is in the range U+0000⋯U+001F"".

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/editor/common/viewLayout/viewLineRenderer.ts#L960-L961

That assumption is incorrect, or at least too narrow to cover this case.

### A possible fix

The right definition for control character for purposes of VS Code is probably, at a minimum, ""anything in the `Cc` and `Cf` [Unicode general categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_character_property#General_Category)"", and not the current definition.

Expected Results:
* I can use keyboard shortcuts for Cut / Copy / Paste while in the quick pick editor

Actual Results:
* All keyboard shortcuts are disabled in this quick pick window.

Root Cause:
During step 5 of the reproduction, VS Code switches focus to the code file you selected from the quick pick.  Additionally, a delayed action fires as the quick pick closes.  The delayed action tells the system to return focus to the element that previously had focus, which was the full-editor webview.

The full-editor webview thinks it has focus, and as a result it absorbs all cut/copy/paste commands that are defined in webview.contribution.ts.

Now, this doesn't seem to work. You can only use a relative path to your current project.

This creates headaches. One uses markdown to take notes, and these notes are in many different folders. The current way requires you to have a .css file floating around in each of these folders containing your notes. Everytime I create a markdown file in a new folder, I have to copy the .css file to that folder. If I don't have the .css file in that project folder, vscode will complain every step of the way as I type in the markdown file. 

The current way doesn't make philosophical sense either. The setting is a _global_ setting, yet its content is with respect to each project differently. For a global setting, why not allowing it to look for an absolute path?",,

# Steps to Reproduce:

In Codespaces (but don't think it's the cause) the integrated terminal text can overlap.

If you resize VSCode to a smaller screen size and type in the integrated terminal you'll have the text that keeps showing up on the same line (eventually erasing the promt and other text).

116840,OPEN,[html] handle HTML-escaped characters in links,bug; html,2021-02-22 15:20:03 +0000 UTC,rjgotten,,"Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

Given trivial HTML or XML content that contains a url with a valid entity escape code:

```xml
<a href=""https://www.example.com/foo.html?bar&amp;baz"">Link</a>
```

**Expected behavior**
The clickable hyperlink directs the user to `https://www.example.com/foo.html?bar&baz`

**Actual behavior**
The clickable hyperlink directs the user to a corrupted version of the url.
The type of corruption differs between XML and HTML document contexts.

_In an XML context_,
`&amp;` is left verbatim and the clickable link directs the user to `https://www.example.com/foo.html?bar&amp;baz`.

_In an HTML context,_
the `&` in the `&amp;` HTML entity is double-escaped using percentage encoding and the user is directed to` https://www.example.com/foo.html?bar%26amp%3Bbaz`.


**Impact**
Not just limited to HTML or XML documents. Can confirm that among other things, this _also_ breaks `<seealso href=""..."" />` type links in C# XMLDoc. Both the in-document clickable link _and_ the link rendered in the popup documentation tooltip.

Something should draw users' attention to the missing credentials. In case of the CLI just printing a reminder to look at the top would be a sufficient workaround but the general solution is better visibility or different placement/size of the credential prompt.

1). Maintain any selection in the editor regardless of any operations related to find-and-replace.
2). Automatically repeat the ""find in selection"" process whenever the find-and-replace interface is opened.
3). Automatically repeat the ""find in selection"" process whenever the selection is changed while the find-and-replace interface is open.
4). Make the ""replace"" operation apply only to the current selection, rather than to all lines intersecting the current selection.
5). Do not replace the ""find"" term with the current selection when opening the find-and-replace interface.

- When I say ""find-and-replace,"" I mean the ctrl+h thing.
- When I say 'repeat the ""find in selection"" process', I mean mimic the behavior of toggling find-and-replace in selection to ""on,"" except observing 1) and 5)).

Item 5) is already possible by itself, but I don't think the other 4 can currently be achieved. At least two of the others have been discussed (e.g. [2)](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/95356), [4)](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/107182)). But I think that these requests, taken together, make find-and-replace work the way that many other users expect, especially new boring corporate users like me.

When using the ""native"" titlebar option, the menubar access keys are not underlined until you press the Alt key.  It should honor the Windows setting for whether to underline access keys.

Really frustrating that in order to be able to see when the app has focus (by using the native titlebar), I can't see the underlined menu items, which is a huge pet peeve.

1. Focus onto an element in Changes view, press `tab` -> focus jump to inline actions (great)
2. Press `shit + tab` -> focus is moved to the Message box 🐛 

It would be cool if `tab` and `shift+tab` are always paired, thus `shift+tab` after a `tab` would bring you back to the original item.

One more corner case
1. Focus onto the first item in changes
2. Press `shift + tab` -> focus is moved in title bar actions 🐛 
3. I would expect the focus to move into the commit box

Overall I think the focus navigation in SCM works nice, thanks to this ""top level"" up and down navigation which allows to focus into something.

116740,OPEN,Explore user profiles,feature-request; ux,2021-04-01 16:58:42 +0000 UTC,misolori,,"## Overview
This issue aims to explore what adding ""profiles"" could look like in the product. These profiles can be used in education, presentations, or can even be language specific. The explorations should cover being able to setup and switch between profiles. Ideally these profiles should be synced with [Settings Sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync) (if used) so you can use those profiles anywhere.

One idea for settings is to introduce a new settings object like:

```jsonc
{
    ""profiles"": {
        ""demos"": {
            ""files.autoSave"": ""onFocusChange"",
            ""editor.fontSize"": 18,
            ""editor.tabSize"": 2,
            ""editor.fontWeight"": ""600"",
            ""screencastMode.enabled"": true,
        }
    },
    
    ""editor.fontFamily"": ""Cascadia Code"",
    ""editor.renderWhitespace"": ""all"",
}
```

The ""Demos"" profile inherits the current settings a user has and adds additional settings on top of the current ones. Also, when profiles are enabled we will create a ""Default"" profile where the user can switch back to their default mode.

- Node.js: 12.14.1
- V8: 8.3.110.13-electron.0
- OS: Linux x64 5.4.80-gentoo-r1-praxis

Steps to Reproduce:

1.  Open an INI type file, typically has the `.ini` extension.
2.  Use the keyboard shortcut to add a comment character.
3. Sometimes (and I can't figure out why) it will insert the CORRECT comment character of `;` but on other occasions it chooses a `#`

<!-- 🔧 Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->
Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: No, if I disable the INI extension (which is part of core) then the commenting parts don't work at all for either the ""INI"" or the ""properties"" type of files.

<!-- 🪓 If you answered No above, use 'Help: Start Extension Bisect' from Command Palette to try to identify the cause. -->
<!-- 📣 Issues caused by an extension need to be reported direct to the extension publisher. The 'Help > Report Issue' dialog can assist with this. -->

I've noticed that in  `ini.language-configuration.json` and `properties.language-configuration.json` there are different comments (""lineComment"").   In the `ini.` file it's indicating `;` and in the `properties.` file it's shown as a `#`   Even when VSCode indicator is showing ""INI"" type the value from the `properties.` file is being selected.

For me this is not happening 100% of the time.  Some files it will properly select semi-colon.  Other files it will select the hash-mark.  VSCode will even select the hash character even in a file that is already commented with semi-colon.  Additionally, sometimes VSCode will select a different character than last time.  That is.  I start fresh VSCode instance and edit ""example.ini"" from scratch; and semi-colon is automatically selected.  Close VSCode. Start Fresh open example.ini; using the keyboard shortcut to comment this time is hash.  And at a later session it might be back to using semi-colon.

116726,OPEN,Community Question regarding Issue Handling,,2021-02-25 23:14:43 +0000 UTC,plainerman,,"Over the last few weeks, I have started regularly contributing to VSCode and helping where I can. But I have seen some issues / PRs that have been left unanswered and have been abandoned due to no response. This could lead to a large backlog, taking a lot of time to maintain, and (speaking from personal experience) can discourage the community members from involving.

Of course, we are all in hurry sometimes (or forget things, are on holiday, sick-leave …), but I was wondering about the team’s perspective on this topic.

Is there a document / section in the wiki that describes a procedure on what a community member can / should do in cases where a discussion in an issue is left unanswered? Or more importantly, there is no reaction on a PR from the assignee? Surely there cannot be one *right* solution, as this varies strongly from case to case, but a general guideline would be very helpful in my opinion. 
From the top of my head, specifically the following questions arise:
* Is there a (rough) estimate on how long one should wait before pinging an assignee again, when a question etc. has been left unanswered? A week? two weeks? 
* What can / should one do, when an assignee does not respond anymore, and pings don’t seem to help? Is there anyone that can be involved in this case to further pursue the issue / PR (e.g. mentioning the person responsible for inbox tracking this week)?
* What to do with existing issues that do not have an assignee anymore?

If there is already a documentation about this, I would suggest linking this in the *How-to-Contribute* section in the wiki. If not, and the procedure is explained to me, I would be happy to add it myself (or maybe even add a link to this issue).

If this is not the correct place to discuss such things, please point me in the right direction. Thanks :)

116673,OPEN,Source Control does not refresh status automatically when working on WSL.,,2021-02-16 12:24:26 +0000 UTC,Suyash1266,,"Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

Whenever any changes are made to a already committed file or a new file is created or basically any changes are made in a git repository not from the source control GUI, the changes made are not synced with VS Code Explorer and need to hit refresh manually to see changes such as U or M tags in the file explorer or file tab.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open any git repository on WSL.
2. Create a new file or edit any previously committed file.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35092213/107919652-b4d91a00-6f91-11eb-86c8-daa4c211f531.mp4

Expected Result - The changes should be synced with Source Control and tags should change accordingly to M or U automatically.

Actual Result - Nothing happens. The clock symbol on source control appears for less than a second when a new file is created from the explorer but still nothing happens. The clock does not even show when creating files from the terminal. Changes are visible on the source control tab only after hitting refresh manually.

Does it work with extensions disabled - Unable to verify. When loaded without extensions the WSL side asks to enable WSL-Remote extension and reload. After reload all extensions get enabled.

PS: This issue does not occur on the windows side of VS Code when working on the same repo and using WSL as terminal. Works as expected.

116664,OPEN,Bash command to clear the VSCode integrated terminal scrollback on Windows 10?,integrated-terminal; under-discussion,2021-02-19 17:44:25 +0000 UTC,denishowe,,"Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

I'm happily running [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) bash in VSCode on Windows with:

`""terminal.integrated.shell.windows"": ""C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe"",`

The ""Terminal: Clear"" command (`workbench.action.terminal.clear`, which I have bound to Control-L) clears not only the screen but also the scrollback buffer, as expected, so trying to scroll up does nothing because there is nothing to show.

How can I reproduce this with a shell command?

The `clear` command does not clear the scrollback, neither does `reset`. These commands work by outputting escape sequences to the screen.  Since the terminal thinks it is ""TERM = xterm-256color"", the relevant escape sequence should be the one output by the shell command `printf ""\e[3J""` which works on all other xterm emulations (and is part of `clear`'s output).  In VSCode it does not clear the scrollback but, oddly, resurrects one screenful of previously cleared scrollback.

Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

Sorry I have little information.  I only just now noticed the ""Process Explorer"" feature that I will try if this happens again.

All I can say is that through Windows Task Manager I discovered that VSCode had gobbled 15G of RAM.  I tried to close it and in Windows task bar it appeared gone but Task Manager showed it still active, so I killed it and the 15G was immediately restored.

Let me know if there is anything I can do to help you diagnose this.

```json

	""terminal.integrated.shell.windows"": ""cmd.exe"",
```
* If I commented the line ```""terminal.integrated.shell.windows""``` (powershell is used instead of cmd) - issue has changed a little bit: console prompt is not displayed until I wrote any symbol. Interesting thing is that this issue with powershell appears only once after vscode has been started. If I close terminal (exit) and open it again - console prompt is displayed correctly.
* If I open cmd.exe in Windows (not in vscode), console prompt is displayed correctly.
* ```""terminal.integrated.scrollback""``` line doesn't impact to this issue.

At the moment I work on my-app/src/something/index.spec.js

I have a long test suite and I want to run only this file's tests.

I usually do:

1. Copy relative path on working file
2. `npm t my-app/src/something/index.spec.js` where the path is pasted from step 1
3. Up arrow twice or more whenever I want to re-run the test suite

What I wanted to do is an alias like `npmt` which would combine `npm t` and the path of the current working file as an argument. The thing is that code does not expose the outcome of `Copy Relative Path of Active File` hence my ticket.

Editor is scrolled to the clicked cell such that the top of the markdown block is just below the middle of the editor window. Typically markdown is used to separate logical blocks of cells in notebooks, so scrolling the clicked cell to the top of the editor window would make more sense.

+ - <_constructor_> // this option has the focus
+ + _method1_

Moreover, when focused on this breadcrumbs menu **you can start typing the name of the element you want to go to**, and press enter to go there. It is great, but **it only works as long as that element is already visible** in the drop-down menu.

Following with my example, this means that I can't start typing _""constr""_ to got to Game's constructor or Square's constructor (nor to any of its methods).

So, to make the breadcrumbs feature more awesome **I'd like to suggest to make it compatible with dot notation**.

This way, I could start typing ""Game.constr"" to go to that element independently from where my cursor is at the moment or which elements are unfolded in the drop-down menu.

Following again the example, let's suppose I want to go to the constructor of the `Game` class. I press ""**Ctrl + Shift+ .**"" and type _""Game.constr""_. The logic I find best would be:
1. Is _""Game.constr""_ an actual element I can go to? (current behavior)
2. If not, is _""Game""_ an element in the current scope?
    1.  If it is, has such element a child which name starts with _""constr""_?
    2. Yeah? Go there and end use case.
3. If not, is ""Game"" an element in the root of the source file
    1. Has such element a child which name starts with _""constr""_?
    2. Yeah? Go there and end use case.
4. If not, the element wasn't found. End of use case.",,

116454,OPEN,Search view focus should be improved,accessibility; feature-request,2021-03-24 00:27:13 +0000 UTC,isidorn,,"1. Open search viewlet, make sure to have the replace also open
2. Press `tab` a couple of times and notice how the focus moves

I understand that this focus movement is designed behaviour since users expect the first tab from the search input to go to the replace input and I think it makes sense.
However there is a lot of very custom code to make this possible. Listening on `tab` presses [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/a0bbfacd8cfeeaebc1c5bd49bb7ffdfb804c4b5b/src/vs/workbench/contrib/search/browser/searchWidget.ts#L556).

This milestone I am trying to change how the `ActionBar` focus navigation works and this would include the search input inline checkbox actions - even though as an implementation they do not use an `ActionBar` they should behave consistently. I would like to make those checkboxes occupy only one tab stop and that users can use `left` and `right` to move focus between them - just like we now do in all `ActionBars`.
I tried changing this in Search however due to the custom focus handling code this proved to be a bit complex.

What I am suggestion is the following tab flow:
Search Input `->` Replace Input `->` Search inline actions `->` Replace inline Actions `->` Toggle Search Details `->` Files to Include `->` Files To Include Inline Actions `->` Files To Exclude `->` Files to Exclude inline actions
Each `->` represents a `tab` press.

observe that it finds only f1,f3 and f5 and completely ignores fields in second column. *  means it should match zero of more characters, so it should match fields in second column.

if I try to find with regex ""[^\t]+"" it works correctly and does find fields in second column.

116420,OPEN,Explore fine grained semantic searching of symbols inside breadcrumbs view,editor-symbols; feature-request,2021-04-05 02:34:59 +0000 UTC,aszenz,,"I think navigating code using breadcrumbs can be improved a lot by incorporating some kind of searching inside the breadcrumbs view.

Here's how i think it might work:

> When I'm inside a method symbol and it's showing me all the symbols inside that method, when I search for `foo`, it should highlight and scroll down to the first symbol named `foo` in that method so i can easily go to it's definition or just see the surrounding symbols around it. Even more useful is if can jump between foo's usages in that particular method.

**This enables quickly jumping to variables and their usages inside a function using structured semantic search.**

>Same goes for files, searching for a file inside a breadcrumb directory should take me straight to where the first match is, even if the file is deeply nested. 

_It's important that the list be not filtered by the filename rather only expanded with matching highlights so that I don't lose the context of where the file is located._

**This will  make it easier to find and jump between files in that directory.**

The interesting part about this is that the existing symbol search using `@` in command bar is already searchable, but it's completely flat and can't do fine grained semantic searching so it's rarely used to navigate code.

The overall goal should be to allow people to navigate their code bases using symbols and not text, this necessitates being able to find and go to symbols in a more fine grained manner than currently possible in vs code. 

At a higher level it's about traversing the constructed language server's AST in a flexible fine grained manner.

I think a new kind of view maybe required for this, a multi level drop down with built in search that can auto expand and highlight searched items even if they are deeply nested inside the drop down tree. 

**Also this can be separate from the existing breadcrumbs view and more likely be built as a new semantic symbol search view.**",,

If you look very closely, you'll notice that that comma is actually marked with a lighter color. So Code does know where the change occurs inside a line. However, that lighter color is very difficult to distinguish from the surrounding color. 

My abstract request: 

**Make it so that changes inside a single line can be seen quickly, at a glance.**

I'm not sure what the best approach for that is, but I'll mention a few possibilities in increasing level of hardness:

1) Change the color of the inside-line changes so that they really pop out from the color of the line. Like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2399754/107606227-26396580-6c3e-11eb-9102-cc6a1e438b89.png)

2) Restrict the line-coloring to the left sidebar. Use coloring inside a line to locate the changes. Like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2399754/107606011-75cb6180-6c3d-11eb-89c0-b4e305d2460e.png)

3) Combination of 1 and 2:

4) Actually, shouldn't the diff just work inside a single line? Like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2399754/107606614-4d446700-6c3f-11eb-9ec9-247ed8599b8a.png)

I dont think this is an issue with tmux. Reason being, when we kill the integrated terminal and create a new integrated terminal under the VSCode and launch the same tmux session, things works fine.

Can you please look into this issue and fix the issue. That would help us from restarting the VSCode integrated terminal every now and then.

* keep main process usage as little as possible

* investigate into turning the shared process into a lightweight node.js process with `MessagePort` support and access to Electron's proxy solution for network requests (if we cannot get proxy support here, we could think about doing ad-hoc hidden windows for network requests as a workaround)

Steps to reproduce:

1. split the terminal in half

2. type something in the left

3. drop a file into the right half, and you'll see the filename goes into the left half

Isn't this weird? I think the file should go to the dropped point instead of the active one.

2. When the file is not open in the editor, use ctrl+shift+f to search for any content in the file. No results appear.
3. Open the file and search again. Results appear.

Specific steps to reproduce on Windows 10:

1. Make a number of nested folders in windows explorer until this error appears:

3. Make a txt file with a specific string in it and search for this string when the file is not opened in the editor.

Hi,

in a list of files I can filter them by start typing the name of the file. It is a super useful feature when you have hundreds+ files.
My issue is that the filter is trying to find the letters in the whole file name. 
Here is an example search for word ""file"":

* this-is-**file**-i-looked-for.jpeg (I expect this to be returned)
* **f**or-th**i**s-**l**.jp**e**g (This should not be returned, it is only a random match)

Would it be possible to add there extra settings to only returns full strings matches? Or is there some setting already buried somewhere?

Thanks a lot for all the work on awesome editor.

##  Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open vscode.
2. Create go/ts file (any file extension which language grammar has many snippets from extensions or from VSCode itself...).

7. _You scrolled to the top_.

Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: _Yes_

## Details

In #109916 @jrieken added a way to disable snippets by clicking on the tooltip in quick input dropdown (which is great). But the issue if you want to disable all snippets from a particular extension, you need to perform this ""scroll, diable, scroll, disable, scroll, disable"", till you get to the top (where the scroll/jump isn't happening or noticeable). 

This is not a bug, but (I guess?) negative user experience on feature implementation. Is there a way to use disable/enable functionality, without drawing picker (which causing jump)?

When opening files by selecting them in the explorer file tree, it sometimes randomly collapses the tree, up to the workspace folder. E.g. given files of this structure:

Workspace 1
  - File a
  - Folder b
    - File c
    - File d

Workspace 2
  - File e

Selecting File C will open it, but also collapse Workspace 1 (leaving just workspace 2 open and File e visible). Clicking the ""refresh"" button at the top of the tree correctly expands the tree with the current file selected.

It takes flicking back and forth between two files several times to reproduce, but it happens randomly during the course of normal usage.

This happens with and without extensions enabled. My current machine is Ubuntu 20.04, but my colleagues have experienced it on Windows and on Mac, for the same workspace.

Start sqlite3 in ubuntu 20.04 terminal. Press enter until on bottom line of terminal window. Press any key until cursor is at bottom right position in terminal window. Keep pressing the key and you'll find the cursor wraps to the beginning of the same line rather than scroll to a new line. Use .exit to exit sqlite3 and the problem persists in the terminal window even though you're back in the bash shell. Additionally, while running sqlite3 the arrow keys don't work properly. They print out characters rather than allow you to move through the command you've just entered or move through bash history.

116150,OPEN,Extension API: Provide a way to add commands to menus in the Mac main menu bar,,2021-02-08 23:44:16 +0000 UTC,shepazon,,"* **Categorization**; allowing new menus to be specified by the user, then allowing extension commands to be added to these menus, lets the user categorize these commands as they see fit. They could even have per-workspace configurations that set up menus with the special scripts used just for each project.

If the concern is about user security, I have ideas:
* Extensions should not be able to alter the built-in menus
* The user, not the extension, should define what menus to add to the menu bar and what goes into them.
 
This could be done using a new setting such as `workbench.menubar` which is essentially an array of objects that describe each custom menu added to the menu bar. Each menu would have a name, any state information needed, and an array of objects describing the contents of the menu.

These objects would specify the command represented by the item, plus a text label for the menu (or `null` to use the command's name), enabled/disabled state, checkmark state, and so forth. Most other information can come from the command's existing implementation.

I think this could provide incredible flexibility for the user while ensuring safety and security.",,
116147,OPEN,Terminal window goes black after switching TTY and back again,,2021-02-08 23:44:48 +0000 UTC,iamcgn,,"Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

Repro Steps:

1. Open new terminal window
1. Notice prompt and terminal window colors all work as expected.
1. Change TTY (i.e. on Ubuntu, Ctrl+Alt+F1)
1. Change TTY back (Ctrl+Alt+F2)
1. Notice Terminal window is now mostly black and only `->` prompt and the cursor are visible. 

Recovery steps
1. None that I've found other than opening a new terminal window

Note: This is new in version 1.53.0. Version 1.52.1 does not have this issue. I have downgraded for the time being as this is a pretty common thing for my workflow.

* To-do list extensions
* Applying filters where an 'Edit' button drops you into the experience above where checkboxes show up
* Crafting `.gitignore`'s or other 'ignores' where you go down the filesystem and uncheck the files you want to ignore

#### Proposal

* TreeItem has new optional property called `checkboxState` similar to `collapsibleState` which takes in a `TreeItemCheckBoxState`:
```ts
        export class TreeItem {
            // ...

            /**
             * [TreeItemCheckboxState](#TreeItemCheckboxState) of the tree item.
             */
            checkboxState?: TreeItemCheckboxState;

            // ...
        }

       /**
	 * Checkbox state of the tree item
	 */
        export enum TreeItemCheckboxState{
		/**
		 * Determines an item can be neither checked nor unchecked. Implies it has no checkbox.
		 */
		None = 0,
		/**
		 * Determines an item is checked
		 */
		Checked = 1,
		/**
		 * Determines an item is unchecked
		 */
		Unchecked = 2
	}

```
* `TreeDataProvider` will have a new optional event `onDidChangeTreeCheckbox` which will fire when the checkbox of a `TreeItem` is checked or unchecked:
```ts
        /**
	 * A data provider that provides tree data
	 */
	export interface TreeDataProvider<T> {
                // ...

                /**
		 * An optional event to signal that an element or root has either been checked or unchecked.
		 */
		onDidChangeTreeCheckbox?: Event<ChangeTreeCheckboxEvent<T>>;

                // ...
        }

        export interface ChangeTreeCheckboxEvent {
                /**
		 * The item that was checked or unchecked.
		 */
		readonly item: <T>;

		/**
		 * Removed workspace folders.

Opening the terminal for a WSL2 instance (Ubuntu 20.04 in this case) defaults to the path mounted at `/mnt/c/users/Ben/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft VS Code` instead of the working directory. The same bug applies whether opening from the desktop/start menu and opening the directory using the browser, or using `code .` within the working directory. This appears to be new with 1.53, although it's been a few weeks since I've last used VSCode so I don't know if the bug was introduced recently or in a previous version.

Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

This problem is exclusive to the cmd and bash terminals (powershell doesn't have it). It also only happens when thhe vscode window is opened in WSL using the Remote-WSL extension. The bash and cmd shells wrap lines properly if the current vscode window is not connected to WSL.

The problem is that when these conditions are met (vscode is connected to WSL and the shell being used in the integrated terminal is bash or cmd). If a command exceeds the length of the terminal window the terminal doesnt make a new line, it glitches and starts overwriting the same line from the start of the window. The command still works fine but its a visual bug.

I am using Windows 10 with 4K Display which is set to 125% DPI. I also use `--disable-renderer-accessibility`.

## Solution

Use 100% or 150% DPI instead of 125%.

116020,OPEN,Git operations in VSCode UI slower than usual,git; needs more info,2021-02-23 21:27:48 +0000 UTC,Alonski,,"Issue Type: <b>Performance Issue</b>

For the past month or more Git operations done in VSCode are quite slow.
An example is when commiting from the Source Control tab I:
1. Have files staged or changed
2. Add a commit message
3. Hit Ctrl+Enter to commit.
4. The UI shows a loader and it seems that committing takes a long time.

In reality as soon at I hit Ctrl+Enter the commit takes place. Testing this via the integrated terminal shows as such.

There were earlier issues surrounding this but not real resolution:

It'd be really nice to be able to specify editor line height as a multiple of font size. 

Pitch for why it's worth considering: 
- It'd be more consistent with the other line height settings in VSCode. (markdown.preview.lineHeight and terminal.integrated.lineHeight are both multipliers--only editor.lineHeight is absolute).
-  It would also unbreak dynamically resizing code on the fly, which is often important while communicating, like in teaching.
- Seems like lots of people change this setting, since [VSCode's spacing default](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/23806) is significantly bigger than most editors and people like seeing lots of code on the page. And [this leads to confusion](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/33968) because most line spacing settings are a multiplier, in VSCode and elsewhere.

Being able to (optionally) specify the value in ems would solve the problem, while remaining backwards compatible. To give concrete examples, ""15"" could remain a valid value (implicitly in pixels), but 1.25em could also be a valid value that would rescale properly if the text size were changed.

Thank you for your consideration--and a truly excellent piece of software!",,

Basically sync stabilized features from electron version into native annually.

Only reason would be extreme performance. As vscode more and more becomes IDE like, performance struggles are starting to show up...


- right clicks seem to take longer
- autocomplete seems to lag
- input latency seems to be noticeable
- color encoding / parsing takes a moment
- jumping to reference isn't fast
- startup time is noticeable
- etc

Don't take me wrong it's by far one of the most performant code editors i've used.

But lot of the things mentioned seem to add up. I personally notice this most when I go from coding on laptop to desktop.

This is because, in order to validate predictions, we manually parse input character-by-character and see how to process it and whether we need to roll predictions back. 

mosh handles typeahead differently: they keep an ""overlay"" buffer that hold predictions and is separate from the buffer that is made up of data from the pty. This allows them to simply apply incoming data unchanged, and then validate data in the overlay versus that in the real buffer. If a character in the overlay is now present in the real buffer, remove it from the overlay. If it's different, just clear the overlay. This removes a ton of complexity that we have now to deal with rolling back and rolling forwards and tracking style changes.

It also means that we would get support for more complex scenarios, like powershell which rewrites the entire line on each character, for 'free' -- no additional complexity in our algorithm, that is. @TylerLeonhardt's been working on getting powershell working with our current approach and is ending up in a series of edge cases and rabbit holes.",,

I works with Flutter and just updated VSCode to version 1.53 yesterday and this thing is happen:

1. Debug Console auto scroll stop scrolling to the end of line, it somehow always stop prematurely at start (just scroll a bit and then stop).
2. Flutter hot reload button was missing  from  Run buttons. The function ctrl+F5 still works though.

I think this is VSCode bug, and not Flutter/Dart bug. Because it happens after 1.53 update.

The Auto Scroll part is really annoying for me.

115912,OPEN,[Notebook] WorkspaceEdit.replaceNotebookMetadata() unsets cell languages.,needs more info; notebook,2021-02-18 16:20:12 +0000 UTC,brettfo,,"
While developing the .NET Interactive notebook extension, I have the following scenario:

- In extension activation, subscribe to `notebook.onDidChangeActiveNotebookKernel()`
- In that handler, call `WorkspaceEdit.replcaeNotebookMetadata()`

Result:
After calling `workspace.applyEdit()`, the cell's languages have been changed, it seems to the first entry in the `document.languages` property.

Expected:
The cell's languages should remain unchanged.

Workaround:
For now I'm capturing all cell data before updating the metadata, including language, then after the document metadata has been updated, I call `WorkspaceEdit.replaceNotebookCells()` to ensure the language is preserved.

115902,OPEN,Code crashes upon force closing the integrated terminal,,2021-02-08 15:52:57 +0000 UTC,Thread4all,,"Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

Force closing the integrated terminal while the code it's running is printing text makes vscode unresponsive, popping up the dialog box for reloading the window.

1. Write some code that continuously prints stuff, like this (it works for C, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Python and Ruby, so it's definitely not a compiler related issue; also the code doesn't necessarily need to be this simple for the issue to occur, the only effective requirement is that the terminal is killed while it is printing something):
``` javascript
    while (true) {
        console.log(""text"");
    }
```
2. Execute it from the integrated terminal;
3. Kill the terminal (using the trash bin icon);
4. Enjoy an unresponsive vscode.

I set `""search.mode"": ""newEditor""`, started a search, dragged the new editor to the left of my working area and reduced it's width so that it kind of looks like a panel:
![Search Mode newEditor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13134791/107062737-e73c8780-67d9-11eb-914e-aff7d5627b8c.gif)

The problem is of course, that the search results open in the same (small) area instead of the main one. (Also, when focus is in the main area, Ctrl + Shift + F won't open the search editor in the ""panel"" on the left.)

### Solution idea 1
Make the search view work like a bunch of search editors docked to the left abandon the search view. (Although I see that there are _subtle differences_ between the two: the search view will show an entry for every occurrence _within_ a line, while the search editor only shows one entry _per_ line.)

### Solution idea 2
Add multi-tab support to the search editor (so it keeps its behavior but still allows for a ""history"" of results being open).",,

## Proposal

A couple of things I explored:

- Moving glyph area to the left of line numbers. This helps create separation between between the scm indicators and a clear area for adding comments.
- Adding button for adding and view comments. This follows a similar pattern on GitHub for reviewing changes.
- Hiding diff chunk areas. This reduces the visual noise and I think most people will be commenting on changed lines in the PR as opposed to lines that are not related
- Adding color to the `+` and `-` changes to look visually pleasing

115768,OPEN,Windows: different zoom levels on different monitors fail to restore windows at correct location,bug; help wanted; windows; workbench-window,2021-02-23 08:46:12 +0000 UTC,bighammer,,"I have extension screens setup: 
- Main screen: laptop resolution 3840x2160 and enlarger text& application size to 200%
- extension screen 1: ultrawide screen 2516x1080, no enlargerment
- extension screen 2: nomral wide screen: 1920x1080, no enlargerment

and using FancyZones from PowerToys to manage my screens.
                 =================================


1.  put vscode in extension screen 1 or 2
2. Drag vscode window & press shift (shortcut of FancyZones) to put to a target sub-screen
2. close vs code, reopen it

Vscode window positon will not restore to the position where I closed it. In addtion, the vscode window size seems enlargered to 200%. My guess is vscode restores window size & position based the coordinator of main screen rather then the extension screen.
I am not sure it is vscode's bug or FancyZones messed up OS ( win10) ?
 
If I just put vscode in main screen or extension screens without using draging it to a subscreen, it works fine. 

=============================
I double checked. It seems nothing to do with FancyZones. If I put vscode in the certain postion in extension screen but close to main screen, the problem will happen.

115679,OPEN,Don't leak RPC objects from API,debt,2021-02-05 09:52:25 +0000 UTC,jrieken,,"This is a continuation of https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/115530 and an effort to make our API implementation more strict/locked-down. 

Most of our API is implemented with the help of RPC calls to the renderer - that can be retrieving data or doing something. This is implemented with a protocol instance and objects that represent a slice of the API, aka proxies, like `MainThreadTextEditorsShape`. These proxies usually mirror the capabilities of the API but are often more powerful and therefore we should make sure these objects cannot be reached from the API. 

These leakages usually occur when having an API implemented as object which holds API-properties _and_ internal/private-properties. Since non-native private properties aren't hidden to consumers an extension can reach them. 

There are usually two ways of fixing this

1. Use a native private property - that is a property which name starts with `#`. Those properties aren't accessible to outsiders but you should know that TypeScript down-level compiles native privates to a construct that uses weak map and is therefore significantly slower. This is a sample commit that hides a proxy by using a native private property: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/commit/a01d16e77e9b7c7f200d6010b78b519e05913d73
1. A **better** approach is to not mix API and implementation into a single class/function-scope but to separate them. c399d039a71998e8cef312a8584851a03c8f2f64 is a sample for that, instead of mixing things the `NotebookEditorDecorationType`-type has now a `value`-property which is the API. All internals are hidden inside the containing class/scope. This has an additional benefit of TypeScript checking that your API isn't too large, e.g when using a literal for a certain API-type then the compiler will check that you have no extra properties. In the sample above having the `NotebookEditorDecorationType.value.notDeclaredAPI :string`-property yield in a compile error.

To test this I have added the [`assertNoRpcFromEntry`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/a0c75f60530da98fbccf796a7c78c23a7ca168d3/extensions/vscode-api-tests/src/utils.ts#L80-L80) and [`assertNoRpc`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/a0c75f60530da98fbccf796a7c78c23a7ca168d3/extensions/vscode-api-tests/src/utils.ts#L76-L76) utilities which recursively crawl an API object and assert that no RPC object can be reached. 

These utilities run during teardown and on objects the API creates, like a status bar entry item. The checking for leaked RPC object does depend therefore on test coverage.",,

115641,OPEN,Design exploration for improving experience for new users,under-discussion; ux,2021-04-06 21:21:24 +0000 UTC,misolori,,"## Overview

This design exploration aims to improve the overall experience for new users while also providing value for existing users. Going through feedback from new and existing users we've heard that:

- Activity bar icons can sometimes be hard to understand if not familiar with them
- Some features (like the command palette and terminal) are hard to discover
- Desire to control overall density

We also wanted to take the opportunity to explore updating the overall aesthetics like:

- Create uniform sizing/padding (using multiples of 4)
- Update default color system
- Alternate placement of account/settings

## Demo

Below is an example of this exploration. Here's a few ideas that we tried:

- Adding labels to the activity bar
- Moving account/settings to the top right
- Introducing an omni search to include commands, files, tasks, etc. (also combining text search into this)
- Introducing a ""density"" toggle (similar to email clients)
- Introducing a Terminal toggle in the status bar
- Introducing GUI features for Git
- Condensed color system into ~10 colors


![design mockup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35271042/106676782-5c0a8a00-656c-11eb-96d8-439204827c21.png)

## Feedback

Here's the feedback I've received on this concept from our team. I'll break down the concepts into individual issue for those we are interested in pursuing more. Note: since this concept touches several ideas at once, it would be good to break down some changes (like density changes and showing more/less UI should be separate).

### Pros
- Friendlier activity bar labels for new users
- Omni search helps discoverability of command palette/search
- Moving settings/accounts in title bar helps separate views from menus
- Consistent spacing makes for a uniform UI
- Easy toggle for changing density

### Cons
- Omni search
  - Can be hard to distinguish
  - Could be too advanced for new users
  - Takes up title bar space (will need to look into OS guidelines)
  - Need to evaluate relationship between Quick Open + Command Palette
  - Can take up dragging real estate for title bar
- Could be costly to maintain two designs w/ density mode
- Some prefer settings/accounts in activity bar

Happy to hear any additional feedback others have on this concept.",,
115626,OPEN,Microsoft Auth Provider should support overriding client id and tenant id,api-proposal; authentication,2021-03-24 01:34:27 +0000 UTC,TylerLeonhardt,,"
As an extension author, I should easily be able to create my own AAD application (in the Azure Portal for example) and use that client id instead of the one vscode uses so that I can have control over the scopes I care about and, if this exists, I can get telemetry when my client id is used.

Since we have abstracted auth providers, I think it's fitting to be able to pass additional auth provider specific options down to an auth provider. For example, the Microsoft auth provider would take a client id and tenant that would replace the hard coded string above.

Proposal:

```ts
        /**
	 * Options to be used when getting an [AuthenticationSession](#AuthenticationSession) from an [AuthenticationProvider](#AuthenticationProvider).
	 */
	export interface AuthenticationGetSessionOptions {
		/**
		 * Whether login should be performed if there is no matching session.
		 *
		 * If true, a modal dialog will be shown asking the user to sign in. If false, a numbered badge will be shown
		 * on the accounts activity bar icon. An entry for the extension will be added under the menu to sign in. This
		 * allows quietly prompting the user to sign in.
		 *
		 * Defaults to false.
		 */
		createIfNone?: boolean;

		/**
		 * Whether the existing user session preference should be cleared.
		 *
		 * For authentication providers that support being signed into multiple accounts at once, the user will be
		 * prompted to select an account to use when [getSession](#authentication.getSession) is called. This preference
		 * is remembered until [getSession](#authentication.getSession) is called with this flag.
		 *
		 * Defaults to false.
		 */
		clearSessionPreference?: boolean;

		/*************/
		/***  NEW  ***/
		/*************/
                /**
                 * Provider specific options for getting this session (i.e. client id, tenant)
                 */
		providerOptions?: { [key: string]: any; }
	}
```

The Auth Provider would then need to be responsible for deciding if it already has created a session with these options or if it needs to create a new session based on these options.",,

    ""editor.tabSize"": 4,
    Make sure the workspace has no settings
    Open the file
    Check in the lower right corner if indentation is tabs or spaces

What I expected:
VS code ignores the already used indentation in the file and uses spaces for future indentation.

What happened:
VS code detected the indentation of the file and kept using tabs instead of spaces for indentation.

115591,OPEN,Custom editors: respect `soft` option when reverting,bug; custom-editors,2021-03-22 22:54:35 +0000 UTC,bpasero,,"I noticed how here we pass in `IRevertOptions` but do not respect them:

The idea of `IRevertOptions.soft` is to really not throw an error because it will prevent an editor from closing when the user clicks ""Don't save"". 

I suggest to implement the `soft` revert in a way that we do NOT talk to the extension but simply do everything on the internal workbench side to clean things up and return immediately.

The green badge says there are two Command that use the same keyboard shortcut - `selectPartOfWord.moveLeft` and `workbench.action.moveEditorToPreviousGroup`.

The advantage is that you can see the same keybindings right away, you don't need to click ""Show Same Keybindings"" for each Command.

Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>

In order to avoid multiple remote tmux sessions, I set in settings.json the following 
 ""terminal.integrated.shell.linux"": ""/usr/bin/tmux"",
    ""terminal.integrated.shellArgs.linux"": [
        ""new-session"",
        ""-A"",
        ""-s"",
        ""${workspaceFolderBasename}""
    ],

I expect that workspaceFolderBasename variable contains valid value. However, initally or after window reload this variable is not set. It is only set correctly after I switch source code tabs or open a file. 

This is a problem when using remote sessions, because this happens  every time I reconnect to the remote session and VSCode tells me to reload window.

[dontDelLF.txt](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/files/5905943/dontDelLF.txt)

Issue Type: <b>Feature Request</b>

It's probably too late, but I request a change to Column Mode editing (Shift, Alt, Click, Drag).  When a Line Feed is in a column selected, it should not be deleted on Delete.  This removes empty lines that editors will most-often want to remain.  This is also more like notepad++ column mode editing which I think got it right.

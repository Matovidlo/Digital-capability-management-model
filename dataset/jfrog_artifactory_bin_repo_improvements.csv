 # Literally, there isn't any info, which type of timestamp must be used in RPM metadata. According to [http://createrepo.baseurl.org/] - ""FIXME The specification needs better and more current documentation and needs to be included here. :)"", LOL. But, looks like, that just a tradition, that all timestamps in RPM should be UNIX timestamp e.g. seconds from Epoch.
 #  Our class representation of files use milliseconds for our timestamps like so:
{code:java}
this.created = System.currentTimeMillis();
this.lastModified = this.created;
{code}
Which means, that we are working with file object attributes as timestamp with milliseconds.

 # The lastModified field takes the value from _ItemInfo_ without any changes. So, that explains, why only one field in _primary.xml_ and widely in rpm metadata contains timestamp with milliseconds - only it comes from the file info. It's need just to convert milliseconds to seconds.

* In addition, if an RPM package was already deployed before the current fix, and nothing was deployed or reindex didn't ran - we fallback to the cached version, but we will still take the right timestamp value in seconds.",,,,,,,

Non UI Authentication cache should work for all docker requests,RTFACT-22824,104630,Improvement,Reopened,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,mattheww,mattheww,08/Jul/20 9:46 PM,10/Feb/21 8:10 AM,18/Feb/21 8:56 AM,,6.20.0,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,"*Problem description:*
The non UI auth cache (https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/LDAP#LDAP-Non-UIAuthenticationCache) doesn't work for docker requests when using basic auth. 

The issue occurs for all docker requests, whether it be for the manifest or the layers. This is due to caching being enabled only with requests that are based off a docker token. The docker client (or a smart remote repo with token based auth enabled) always goes to v2/token as a first request, upon every command (pull,push,etc) and then uses the retrieved token for all subsequent requests to artifactory for the same purpose (i.e all layers pulled by the same docker pull request).

*What is the expected behavior?*
-all docker API authentication requests are cached all the time

*Steps to reproduce:*
-enable ldap debug logs

-try to resolve the manifest/layer via curl multiple times:
curl -u admin:password1 http://mill.jfrog.info:12507/artifactory/api/docker/docker-local/v2/busybox/manifests/latest 
curl -u tuser:password http://mill.jfrog.info:12507/artifactory/api/docker/docker-local/v2/busybox/blobs/sha256:91f30d776fb27944b3febb64600db83a880fb4af3f55442f3ad5ee1a786295bf -O

-notice in ldap debug logs that there is a cached key entry, yet it still reaches out to ldap. Behavior occurs for both internal and LDAP users

filelist gets progressively slower the larger a repository gets,RTFACT-22800,104437,Improvement,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,loreny,loreny,07/Jul/20 11:29 PM,10/Feb/21 8:13 AM,18/Feb/21 8:56 AM,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact
When a customer uses any kind of replication, the replication process will some how involve the filelist; e.g. event based pull and push fall back on a CRON schedule. the CRON relies on the file list method, which (basically linearly) scales with size/folder complexity of a repository, even if the actual diff of the folders is small.

Steps to reproduce
create a repository with many files and folders; I did ~2.3m artifacts (each file in its own folder) on an artifactory with a total of ~4m artifacts, and run, against localhost:
time curl -u <creds> ""localhost:8081/artifactory/api/storage/<large repo here>/?list&deep=1&listFolders=1&mdTimestamps=1&statsTimestamps=1&includeRootPath=1"" -O

For my size, it takes 59 minutes to retrieve the filelist - this is against artifactory 6.20 that is doing nothing else with a external mysql DB. In comparison, a customer with a busier artifactory saw this filelist take about 3-5 hours to complete.

Workarounds
N/A

customer impact
 As this filelist makes many calls against the DB to retrieve this information, any customer who has sufficient number of repositories (100+) will see spikes in their DB whenever CRON replication is triggered. Whilst this is expected, and we generally recommend spreading out replication CRON schedules for large repositories to reduce the overall spike - the time of this filelist does not appear to be majorly affected by concurrency, and it reduces the effectiveness of having the CRON as a back up if the filelist takes hours to complete, and it may even overlap its CRON period depending on duration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact

When a user has dozens or hundreds of licenses/bucket licenses, for obvious reasons he/she will not copy over single license files from filesystem to Terraform, as it can become a tedious work to manage licenses in Terraform when they get expired/renewed/replaced, etc. In this case, when replacing an existing node with new node with higher version it fails to upgrade due to missing licenses at the filesystem level, and as a result, the new node/service becomes unavailable. Adding the licenses through the UI of the node, or through JFrog Mission Control (JFMC) is not possible either as the service of the node is unavailable.

As a result, it seems to get the default header size, which is 8k for the version node that is in Artifactory 7.2.1 (node v10.16.3).

There are ways to configure tomcat to allow larger headers via the system.yaml, but there isn't a way to configure frontend. To work around this, I edited /opt/jfrog/artifactory/app/bin/artifactoryCommon.sh's node startup command to include the flag, which is a hacky way to force the header change on restart. 
{code:java}
initNode() {

 As Artifactory is not synchronized with the Docker client, we may receive the ""manifest unknown"" and ""Forbidden"" error messages.
 This confuses the developers using Docker repositories with Artifactory, as they are not aware what causes the ""manifest unknown"" and it is difficult for them to troubleshoot it and associate it with the Block Download policy that was configured.
 It will be good for the customers to have a descriptive error message that specifies the root cause of the failed Docker pull request.

*Steps to reproduce*


 Set up a policy with ""Block Download"" and ""Block Unscanned Artifacts"" in Policy and set it on the Watch that manages the Docker repositories.

*Expected Behaviour:* The support bundle should capture the files which are only 24 hours old if ""*Last 24 hours*"" is selected. Instead of capturing the files using the names which have a timestamp, it should be captured using the timestamp on the server.

*Severity Level*: ** 4 (Whenever the customer wants to share the latest logs, the support bundle is including the old logs increasing the size of the files, which are not expected and which is limiting the security measures for the customer as irrelevant and old data is being sent to the vendor.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact

 * X-Ray/Artifactory web views
 ** We define Policies and Watches on custom artifact/package repositories (npm and maven)
 ** Security folks review list of vulnerabilities/findings and choose to ""Ignore"" if acceptable
 *** Maybe the 3rd party developers haven't fixed yet (i.e. open bug)
 *** Maybe the attack vector and blast radius don't touch our software
 *** Maybe we just don't mind the risk
 * Developers
 ** Using Eclipse and Visual Studio Code plugins, we proactively monitor the X-Ray health of software applications while developing
 *** Re-scan on new modules/components
 *** Double check that we didn't introduce something new
 ** Developers can then make updates (e.g. version upgrade) to see if it mitigates a vulnerability

 

Improvement/request:
 * It would be nice if we could bind our local source code to a watch policy
 * If a finding (e.g. npm module or maven JAR dependency) was flagged as ""High"" but later ignored under the policy, the IDE should reflect that status based on the policy that the local project is bound to.
 * If unbounded, it'll always show the raw results of scans (i.e. not interrupted by an X-Ray user or policy)

 

Without this feature, I'm afraid these plugins have little use for us in proactive monitoring as we sometimes have to just ""ignore""  Highs.  They do have some use when we're trying to resolve a dependency so we can continue to work with these tools.

Previously the Artifactory API allowed admins to determine the latest timestamp of when a given user interacted with Artifactory via the API. Apparently this changed to just be the latest timestamp of when a given user interacted with Artifactory through the UI. 

We would argue that the vast majority of Artifactory interactions comes from the backend due to automation and command line interfacing. We also see value in being able to track when a user logs into the UI. We would like to request that the [https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-GetUserDetails] call would return both values i.e. the timestamp of when a user last accessed API and UI presumably via authentication events. 

This would be vital to our efforts of being able to accurately determine our active user base as well as cull inactive accounts. Many of our users never interact with the UI so this is why API interaction timestamps would enable us to be more precise in maintaining our instance and its analytics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact

It would be very helpful to have a feature in the Artifactory; making it possible to distinguish Direct & Indirect dependencies of each artifact.

So customer can view this distinction on the scanned artifacts as well in the xray; specially for the components with vulnerability alerts or copyleft licenses.

 {{[https://artifactory.example.com/api/storage/maven-releases/com/example/example-service/1.0.0/example-service-1.0.0.war?properties]}}

and the {{properties}} map for this given artifact is empty, it returns an HTTP 404 response with the following JSON:
{code:json}
{
  ""errors"": [
    {
      ""status"": 404,
      ""message"": ""No properties could be found.""

Problem:
 - returning an HTTP 404 is not desirable here as it is not the appropriate API response, and it creates issues with HTTP clients trying to interact with the API thinking that the HTTP ""resource"" is missing (404) when in fact it is not missing, it is simply empty (the map being empty)

Solution:
 - return HTTP 200 as the {{properties}} map is in fact considered ""empty"", not ""missing""

Note:
 - there is a definite distinct between a resource being ""missing"" vs it being ""empty""
 - this is especially important because of the following 2 use cases:
 -- _valid_ API call:
 --- [https://artifactory.example.com/api/storage/maven-releases/com/example/example-service/1.0.0/example-service-1.0.0.war?properties]
 -- _invalid_ API call:
 --- [https://artifactory.example.com/api/storage/maven-releases/com/example/example-service/1.0.0/example-service-1.0.0.war?doesNotExist]
 - both of these use cases return the same type of 404 JSON, which is incorrect API behaviour, because for the first use case it would be much more appropriate to return an HTTP 200 with an empty {{properties}} map, while in the second use case it is in fact a ""missing"" resource (it does not exist)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact

I can confirm that we are having this issue with multiple GitLFS clients. There is no option for the users to re-authenticate because all of this activity is happening within a git clone. We are able to remediate the issue on a case by case basis by having users set lfstokentimeout to 1800 seconds e.g.

 * Two stable environment failures due to plugin jar files being corrupted by this feature and deletion of jar files not being replicated. (RTFACT-20895)

Change the Maven Metadata Implementation,RTFACT-21403,91843,Improvement,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,alan-czajkowski,alan-czajkowski,26/Feb/20 8:43 PM,07/Apr/20 10:44 PM,18/Feb/21 8:56 AM,,6.9.6,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,"For remote repositories, Artifactory treats Maven metadata as a cache-able item with a cache expiry.

Problem:
- as soon as the cached metadata expires, Artifactory must go out to the remote repository to retrieve it as soon as someone makes a request to Artifactory for an artifact in this remote repository
-- this cache setting is configured through: Metadata Retrieval Cache Period
- this creates a performance problem for the first person trying to hit this remote repository that has this expired metadata, this performance bottleneck is especially visible with Virtual Repositories that have remote repository members

Solution:
- don't treat the Maven metadata as an expirable cacheable item, instead just create a setting to ""refresh"" the metadata at a configurable frequency (that fires off a background task that retrieves the latest metadata) and the item does not expire, it only gets replaced on the next ""refresh""

The benefits of changing this implementation is that nobody ever has to experience a crippling slow Maven metadata retrieval when it ""expires"", instead the metadata should never expire and only be updated in the background periodically (through some configurable value).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact

Such behavior would likely require a list of cached Maven metadata files, and the system would need to ping the remote site to see if there is a change on the package. It may improve performance of an initial build run that pulls the same package metadata.

There are two headers that may support such a task, they cause the remote site to return a ""304 not modified"" reply if the checksum or timestamp matches:

Integration of keycloak also for user authorization,RTFACT-21392,91748,Improvement,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,art,art,26/Feb/20 7:15 AM,11/Mar/20 9:01 AM,18/Feb/21 8:56 AM,,,,,,,Artifactory Home,OAuth,,,,0,,,,,,,,"Currently we use keycloak with OIDC to authenticate users in artifactory. But it would be great to use keycloak also for authorization, keycloak supports the scope roles where you can also request all roles for a user. This roles could be used to match them with permissions in artifactory.

For example:

There is a private generic repository: P012345

And two permissions P012345_reader (read access) and P012345_author (write access) attached to this repository.

In keycloak we have two users Gonzo who has the role P012345_reader and Kermit who has the roles P012345_reader and P012345_author. If Kermit logs in these roles could be matched to the permissions in artifactory and kermit would get write access to the P012345 repository.

Also possible as naming convention for keycloak to prevent unwanted access the roles could be named: artifactory_P012345_reader and artifactory_P012345_author artifactory would then just match all roles with the artifactory_ prefix.

At the same time we can not just get rid of the Ports, as we have lot of developers that have developed code and scripts that use the ports. We need a system that can use both Port, even if we never add another Port, and the ability to use Repository Path.

Notice the the the above command has distribution as Bionic and one component Main.

 

Then if we run the below command:

Notice that after issuing the second command:

Bionic distribution now has a new component Backports added to it.
 Xenial distribution now has component Main added to it.
 This should not take place

We had a workaround were we split each command to a different local repository and then configure both under one virtual repository, however this will mean you will need to manage several pools of the package for each distribution.

In the official Debian repositories there is only one pool.

Without distinct, it runs in ~ 1ms

The batching query takes ~1m30s. This is a case where DISTINCT is a huge problem - you have to sort every row that matches the predicate, rather than doing a super fast index scan on nodes_pk which is a 6GB external disk sort of 23,862,828 rows - at this rate it would take 248 days for just the batch queries. Without distinct it's under 1ms, so more like 2 1/2 days.","10/Mar/20 5:15 PM;gordonmessmer;""Seems necessary due to the multiple joins against node_props, but AQL could emit a query that naturally resulted in distinct results""

Is that the same issue as: https://www.jfrog.com/jira/browse/RTFACT-7297 ?

We're running Artifactory 6.16.0, and seeing the behavior described in that earlier ticket: given several ""or"" cases, AQL generates a query that joins node_props multiple times, which results in an extremely slow query.  Using PostgreSQL backend, the query that AQL generates requires 20GB of pgsql_tmp disk space and 109 seconds of execution time.  Rewriting the query to eliminate the extra joins gets us the same result with no disk use, and 0.0006 seconds of execution time.

This Jira is regarding the situation where a repository is indexed, but then we remove it from indexing in Xray, and only then we delete the repository from Artifactory. This causes Artifactory to not send the delete event to Xray since this repository is not marked as indexed, and leaves orphan components in Xray. Steps to reproduce:
 * Add Artifactory instance to Xray.
 * Create a repository in Artifactory and deploy an artifact to it (""artifactory-5.9.1.zip"" in this case, from Bintray).
 * Index the repository.
 * Make sure that the components are added to Xray's components list.
 * Remove the repository from Xray BEFORE the next step - remove it from the idexed resources.
 * Delete the repository and its contents from Artifactory.
 * After deletion, the ""artifactory-5.9.1.zip"" component will remain in Xray, with the location being the repository that was deleted (even though it doesn't exist anymore).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact

Our Artifactory instance is heavily used with over 3000 engineers.

It has happened both from by JFrog administrators who generate tokens as well as other users of the platform.

After further investigation, the Java class that gets the storage size calculates the total size and the free space to get the used space value.

This might not be accurate since the classss gets the total freespace and not the actual usable space by the user/process.

This causes incosistencies in the information from the 'df -h' command.

Long story short, we need to find some more accurate way to present the data.

The method for the space calcualtion:

public FileStoreStorageSummary(List<File> binariesFolders, BinaryProvidersInfo<Map<String, String>> binaryProvidersInfo) {
 this.binariesFolders = binariesFolders;
 binariesStorageTemplate = binaryProvidersInfo.template;

Support case insensitive include and exclude patterns for PyPi repositories,RTFACT-20646,84313,Improvement,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,adiv,adiv,18/Nov/19 2:37 PM,17/Sep/20 12:46 PM,18/Feb/21 8:56 AM,,,,,,,,,,,,2,PB_Done,,,,,,,"As mentioned in the KB article [https://jfrog.com/knowledge-base/how-do-i-use-include-and-exclude-patterns-on-a-pypi-repository/], since using the regular Include and Exclude patterns of *names of artifacts* will not work on PyPi repositories, in order to configure Include and Exclude patterns that will work on PyPi repositories you will need to use the Include and Exclude patterns to Include/Exclude the packages *metadata* (not its name).

In an opposite use case, if a customer wants to exclude *all artifacts except for a few that he wants to include*, it becomes harder to configure, since Artifactory uses the include and exclude patterns as case sensitive. If you have a package that you would like to include, for example - ""{color:#14892c}Cython{color}"", since its name starts with an upper case letter in the remote repository, you will need to create 2 different include patterns for it:
 # ""{color:#14892c}**/cython*{color}"" (this pattern will allow to include the *metadata file* for this package which is always saved with lower case letters no matter the package name).
 # ""{color:#14892c}**/Cython*{color}"" (this pattern will allow to include the *package itself* since it is saved with an upper case).

Except for those two patterns you will need to make for each package you want to include, you will also need to create the pattern - ""{color:#14892c}**/simple.html{color}"" to allow the index file for the repository to be pulled (if this is not present, no packages will be able to be pulled).

In the Python PEPS documentation (specifically PEP-426: [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0426/#name)] it says:

""{color:#59afe1}All comparisons of distribution names MUST be case insensitive, and MUST consider hyphens and underscores to be equivalent.{color}""

 

In order to be aligned with the Python PEPS requirements, we need to make the include and exclude patterns (for PyPi repositories *only*) case insensitive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact

While using docker pull the execution time is 1.6 secs with DISTINCT in db query. Execution time reduces drastically without DISTINCT in the DB query,RTFACT-20629,84111,Improvement,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,swarnenduk,swarnenduk,15/Nov/19 12:52 PM,16/Feb/21 5:45 AM,18/Feb/21 8:56 AM,,6.10.8,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,"Customer is using Enterprise+ 6.10.8 with Postgres. On this and previous versions they have been seeing sporadic but persistent read timeouts for pulls from our docker registry (v2 registry – 7 million artifacts). They have also been seeing CPU usage spikes in our database coinciding with the timeouts and also latency of 1.8 seconds on response from Artifactory also coincident with these timeouts. The machines in question are adequately provisioned.

The offending query is as follows:

{{select distinct}}
{{ n.repo as itemRepo,}}
{{ n.node_path as itemPath,}}
{{ n.node_name as itemName,}}
{{ n.created as itemCreated,}}
{{ n.modified as itemModified,}}
{{ n.updated as itemUpdated,}}
{{ n.created_by as itemCreatedBy,}}
{{ n.modified_by as itemModifiedBy,}}
{{ n.node_type as itemType,}}
{{ n.bin_length as itemSize,}}
{{ n.node_id as itemId,}}
{{ n.depth as itemDepth,}}
{{ n.sha1_actual as itemActualSha1,}}
{{ n.sha1_original as itemOriginalSha1,}}
{{ n.md5_actual as itemActualMd5,}}
{{ n.md5_original as itemOriginalMd5,}}
{{ n.sha256 as itemSha2}}
{{from nodes n}}
{{where ( n.node_name like $1 escape '^' and n.repo = $2) and n.node_type = $3}}

Analysis on the query is as follows:

 Planning time: 0.125 ms
 Execution time: 16161.358 ms
(8 rows)

This is 1.6 secs which is slow. They identified that the use of DISTINCT in the query as the problem. The customer states: “distinct on non-indexed fields needs to compare all the values of those fields and since that didn't fit in the allowed sort memory buffer for the db connection, postgres had no other option then to sort them on disk”


See the line in the previously quoted log: “Sort Method: external merge Disk: 318648kB”

Without the DISTINCT the execution time drops from 1.6 seconds to 0.025ms:

 Planning time: 0.052 ms
 Execution time: 0.025 ms


The customer wants to remove this latency and these sporadic timeouts for the docker pull.


The customer has the below questions:

1. What causes this query to be generated – it looks like it might be generated from a simple GET for a specific artifact.
2. Whether the use of DISTINCT is actually necessary for this call as a starting point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact

Meaning, whenever a node from an Artifactory HA cluster is (re)deployed, the VM's are recycled, and as IPs are dynamic, they change every time a new VM is deployed. 
This causes the remote_stats table in the database to become polluted, as they are coupled with Artifactory IP addresses. Note that specifically for Artifactory, the node.id is being cycled as well.

The structure(Columns of the remote_stats) table  has the following values:

{color:#d04437}   *node_id   |    origin     | download_count | last_downloaded | last_downloaded_by | path*{color}


The Origin column in the above remote_stats table are populated with each IP address of the Artifactory instances; this is not useful since the IP's are dynamic in an immutable infrastructure. So when you run an AQL query to get remote downloads, you get an array of information, that contains downloads from before and current:

  ""name"" : ""public.deb"",

Since Artifactory isn't using Tomcat's RemoteIpValve:

[https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/api/org/apache/catalina/valves/RemoteIpValve.html]

We cannot use the X-Forwarded-For requests and overwrite the origin value in the remote_stats table.

Instead of the having the IP address of the VM's as the origin values in the remote_stats table, if we have a more static value like the servername or the License's hash as the Origin, the count value will be more relevant and so that we do not lose on the historical data on the remote_stats table in the database for the download counts.

select * from stats_remote;

Artifactory fails to fetch metadata for RPM remote repository when metadata is corrupted,RTFACT-20416,82367,Improvement,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,muhammedk,muhammedk,24/Oct/19 10:53 AM,16/Feb/21 6:29 AM,18/Feb/21 8:56 AM,,6.11.3,6.13.0,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,"Whenever the metadata for the RPM remote repository cache is corrupted, Artifactory fails to update the metadata from the remote endpoint and the yum client fails with the error ""Metadata file does not match checksum"". We tried setting the ""Metadata retrieval cache period"" to 0 and we expect that as this parameter is set to 0, Artifactory should be able to fetch the metadata every time a request comes but the request is not handled until and unless we delete the contents of the cache and perform zap cache. 

We were able to reproduce the same behaviour by corrupting the metadata manually.

These are the steps we followed,
 # Create a remote repository ""rpm-elastic"" in Artifactory instance Art-1 which connects to [https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/]
 # Create a smart remote repository ""rpm-smart-elastic"" in other Artifactory instance Art-2 which points to ""rpm-elastic"" repository of Art-1.
 # Configure the yum client to work with ""rpm-smart-elastic"" and we would be able to install and list the elasticsearch packages.

Now to reproduce the issue,

1. Created one local repository ""rpm-local"" in Art-2 and added the corrupted metadata files.
 2. Replicated the metadata files from ""rpm-local"" to ""rpm-smart-elastic"" repository, now the ""rpm-smart-elastic"" contains the corrupted metadata file in its cache.
 3. Once the files are replicated, we changed the remote endpoint of the smart remote repository ""rpm-smart-elastic"" to point to the ""rpm-elastic"" repository of Art-1.
 4. When we try to list or install the elasticsearch package using the yum client, it throws ""Metadata file does not match checksum"" instead of fetching the new metadata from Art-1's ""rpm-elastic"" repository.

To work around the issue, we manually should clear the cache and perform zap cache so that Artifactory could get the new Metadata from the remote endpoint otherwise we can use the expirePackagesMetadata plugin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact

Another solution would be to organize Build Info into folders (in the Build Info repository) by specifying the target folder when publishing them and then assign a permission target on this folder. In that way, Artifactory doesn't rely on the build name (via a regexp) to set permissions.

Example for the 2nd solution : 

Let's say team A wants to publish and access their Build Info  in Artifactory, the Build Info name will take by default the CI Job name or the team can set it.
 If they want to publish it they need the permission from the Artifactory admin. So the admins *have to know the name in advance* or agree on a naming convention regarding the Build Info name (which is not always possible)
  
 Now let's say that we can store team A's Build Info into *Build-Info-Repo/TeamA folder* and then in the Artifactory permission system, we specify that any Build Info in that folder will be visible to Team A, this will greatly simplify the way to manage Build Info as it relies on 1 single criteria which is the folder where the Build Info is stored. Team A will have to publish into their folder ==> CLI + CI plugin Feature request.
  
 Now in Xray, instead of having to select Build Info by their name, the user just target Team A's folder in the Build Info repository.
  
 With this system, Artifactory/Xray Admins can assign permissions once for all for Build Info in advance without having to know the Build Info names.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact

RPM has, since v4.12, supported weak and very weak upstream/downstream dependency tagging through the use of the ""Recommends:"", ""Suggests:"", ""Supplements:"", and ""Enhances:"" tags. Our use case would benefit from Artifactory reflecting these tags, and we are requesting their inclusion in the RPM Info tab alongside the regular dependencies. Specifically our system use case would benefit from this feature for reasons including the following:
 # We need to be able to query (using AQL) for all upstream providers of a weak dependency, so we can install them into a full system configuration (if they exist).  But unlike hard dependencies, a missing weak dependency isn’t considered an error.
 # After selecting a set of packages (using AQL) to assemble into a full system configuration, we need to be able to query for unsatisfied weak dependencies of that system.  This is used to produce a report for human consumption.
 # We need to be able to query for all downstream consumers of a weak dependency, so we can determine impacts of changes to the upstream source.

total 4
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root   43 Sep 20 13:13 artifactory.service -> /usr/lib/systemd/system/artifactory.service

This symlink apparently deployed from your RPM is not required. The file in /etc is used to override the file in /usr/lib/systemd/system/ provided by the RPM. Linking them makes no sense and has no impact on the service state. It only makes it more confusing and difficult if somebody wants to override the default service file.

2) /usr/lib/systemd/system/artifactory.service should not be executable, this causes warnings in the logs while starting.

3) Your systemd unit seems to point to an old school sysv init script in /opt/jfrog/artifactory/bin/artifactoryManage.sh . 
This is really strange and seriously complicates debugging...
I propose to replace all that and get some inspiration in other Tomcat applications, like for example Atlassian Jira, that works fine with RHEL 7.7...

Optimize Concurrent Docker Requests for Smart Remote Repository ,RTFACT-20162,78942,Improvement,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,angellom,angellom,20/Sep/19 10:09 PM,16/Feb/21 8:56 AM,18/Feb/21 8:56 AM,,6.12.2,6.4.3,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,"When concurrently downloading Docker layers, Artifactory will request the same layer multiple times, and will continue to do so until the layer is cached.

Let's say we have two clusters; cluster A and cluster B.

B hasn't cached the image yet, and A might be a remote with cached or not.

Concurrent downloads in cluster B sends out multiple download requests to cluster A for the layers, and only when cluster B completes caching a layer cluster A stops receiving new requests for that layer. 

For example, an image has 2 layer: layer 1 (1MB), layer 2 (100GB)

Since layer 1 is small, cluster B caches it quickly, so cluster B only sends out a handful (less than 10 requests out of 100) to cluster A.

Whereas layer 2 is big, it takes a while to finish caching. Cluster B keeps receiving new requests for layer 2, so it will continue to reach out to cluster A to download layer 2, until the cache completes.

This results in more than 50 of requests already sent out to cluster A.

For existing repository, when asked for server capabilities, Artifactory returns the list {{['complex_search', 'checksum_deploy', 'revisions']}}. If the repository doesn't exist it returns {{['complex_search', 'checksum_deploy', 'revisions', 'only_vs']}}. The value {{only_v2}} is quite important because it tells Conan client that only API v2 endpoints methods are available.

The problem is that the error that the Conan client can report to the user has nothing to do with the actual error. Conan client will tell the user to switch to v2, but the problem is in the repo URL.

"safe, atomic folder removal not available",RTFACT-19712,75863,Improvement,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,trapexit,trapexit,23/Jul/19 2:55 PM,22/Aug/19 2:56 PM,18/Feb/21 8:56 AM,,6.11.3,,,,,Artifactory Home,,,,,0,,,,,,,,"In POSIX filesystem API when removing a directory with rmdir the action is atomic and only succeeds if the directory is empty. 

In Artifactory when a folder is removed it can contain other folders and files. The delete will succeed regardless of what may or maynot be in the folder. This means there is a race condition and a chance of phantom data loss.

In the Artifactory User Plugins repo there is a plugin which checks if the folder has any content and if it finds nothing it will remove the folder with `repositories.delete()` but there appears no way to limit a 3rd party from pushing into that folder while that delete is happening or having happened the moment just before the system calls the 'delete.'

In our usecase we're regularly automatically pruning artifacts. Some of them exist in a hierarchy of folders. With the level of churn we expect the likelihood of phantom data loss is high.

If 'move' is atomic then it could be possible to ""rename, check if empty, move back if not or delete"". However, it's not clear if move is atomic and the code required to ""move back"" when there is conflict would be more complicated than the POSIX FS like behavior. There would also be a risk of that ""renamed"" object being unnecessarily replicated. That could be worked around with a replication plugin and tagging objects not to replicate but that is getting extremely convoluted for what should be a relatively simple and safe behavior.

Latest versions of some python packages require python 3.5 or higher,RTFACT-19549,74629,Improvement,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,scottm,scottm,06/Jul/19 12:12 AM,17/Feb/21 8:15 AM,18/Feb/21 8:56 AM,,,,,,,PyPI,,,,,0,,,,,,,,"Many newer versions of python packages only support python 3.5 or higher. PyPi on the internet implements the PEP508 standard to let pip know not to use these newer versions, however the artifactory does not.

 

Example jupyter-console version 6 is only compatible with py>= 3.5. On pypi, there is a tag on the html link as 'data-requires-python="">=3.5"""". This does not appear on artifactory. The consequence is that it is difficult to install jupyter notebook and other packages on python 2.7.

 

‘pip install jupyter’

Example from [https://pypi.org/simple/jupyter-console/]

Pip will download this page and see that the link for version 6.0.0;
 * <a href=""<removed>"" data-requires-python="">=3.5"">jupyter_console-6.0.0.tar.gz</a>

Has a field called ‘data-requires-python=”>=3.5”’

Pip for python 2.7 will then know to exclude this package when determining which version to download from the page.

 

Version 5.2.0 does not have the tag, and so is selected and installed by pip;
 * <a href=""<removed> "">jupyter_console-5.2.0.tar.gz</a>

 

Example from Artifactory mirror
 * <a href=""<removed>"" rel=”internal"">jupyter_console-6.0.0.tar.gz</a>

As you can see, the ‘data-requires-python=”>=3.5”’ field is not present. Pip will then assume that I want the latest version of the package (6.0.0), download it and check the version of python required. This then fails, as pip sees we have an invalid python version. However, pip will not download or check any other versions of the package to see if they work.

This becomes a problem when you configure replication to another Artifactory instance, where metadata is calculated at a certain depth, but since metadata is not replicated, the repositories will never be in sync with regards to file count, making JFMC DR show that the DR is not in sync.

Steps to reproduce:

Update REST API repository drill-down behavior to match UI ,RTFACT-19311,72785,Improvement,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,Black,Black,30/May/19 3:07 PM,17/Sep/20 12:46 PM,18/Feb/21 8:56 AM,,6.5.13,,,,,REST API,,,,,2,PB_Done,,,,,,,"This is a formal improvement request to resolve support request #105317.

Scenario:

Local repository with files at a/b/c/d and a/b/c/e. User1 has permission to see the first set of files, user2 has permission to see the second set.

In the GUI, either user can expand the “a” directory and see the “b” directory beneath it, since it is a parent directory of one of their defined permissions. Similarly, if either of them opens the “b” directory they see the “c” directory beneath it. And when opening the “c” directory they see the appropriate directory beneath that one based on their permissions. That they are unable to see the file at the intermediate location “a/b/c” is expected.

In the REST API with the GET /api/storage/\{repoKey}/\{folder-path} endpoint, if either user queries the “a” directory they do *NOT* see the “b” directory and are returned a 403 error. If they query “a/b” or “a/b/c” they get the same thing. Only when they query the full directory path of their permission do they get a non-error result. They are thus unable to use the REST API to navigate to files that they have permissions to in the same way as they can in the GUI. Use of the REST API requires knowledge of permission paths that use of the GUI does not.

Not seeing files along the path that they have no access to is desired. Not seeing intermediate parent directories of their permission paths is a functional difference between the GUI and the REST API, and we would like to know how to have the REST API return the intermediate parent directories so that it can be used for exploratory navigation in the same fashion.

Request:

Use of the GET /api/storage/\{repoKey}/\{folder-path} REST endpoint should function more like the UI drill-down. Ideally:
 * Navigation to a folder-path where permissions have been granted should return a 200 and a list of the elements in that location. This is current behavior.
 * Navigation to a folder-path where permissions have not been granted, but is a parent path step to a location where permissions have been granted, should return a 200 and a list of child folders that could be traversed to eventually reach the granted permission folder-path.
 * Navigation to a folder-path where no permissions have been granted and that is not a step to a deeper granted permission should return 404 (preferred) or 403 (current behavior).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Problem statement and Impact

Not being able to know when a file was created in Artifactory, makes it impossible to know exactly how long it took to replicate that file to a target server (via a pull replication).","18/Jun/19 4:01 PM;francois.ritaly;This JIRA should be changed from ""Improvement"" to ""Bug"" because this is clearly a bug.","18/Jun/19 4:39 PM;damiend; 

In JFrog's REST documentation for the Copy Item REST call it is stated:
{code:java}
Copy Item

Description: Copy an artifact or a folder to the specified destination. Supported by local repositories only.
Optionally suppress cross-layout module path translation during copy.
You can test the copy using a dry run.
Copy item behaves similarly to a standard file system and supports renames. If the target path does not exist, the source item is copied and optionally renamed. Otherwise, if the target exists and it is a directory,
the source is copied and placed under the target directory.
 {code}
 

In standard filesystem copy the file in the destination folder will have a different creation date than in the source folder.

One can choose to *preserve* the creation date with an optional flag to cp command:
{code:java}

   -p    Cause cp to preserve the following attributes of each source file in the copy: modification time, access time, file flags, file mode, user ID, and
           group ID, as allowed by permissions.  Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Extended Attributes (EAs), including resource forks, will also be preserved.
{code}
 

We appreciate that it would probably not be a runner for you to change the current behaviour as you may have customers that have built tooling around the creation date *not* being changed.

However, without having an accurate creation date on files that are promoted to repositories you cannot tell with any accuracy how long they have then taken to be replicated from one Artifactory instance to another in that repository.

 

Would you consider having the date behaviour change as an optional system flag at startup i.e if set then have copy item resultin new datestamp?","17/Mar/20 8:58 AM;francois.ritaly;Found another instance where this bug creates an issue for our end users.

Because files copied / moved in repositories don't have their ""created"" / ""modified"" dates set correctly, it's not possible for end users to infer what the latest version of a file is from the files' created dates.

This typically happens in this scenario:
- A file *F1* is published to a repository *A* (its created / modified dates (created(F1) and modified(F1)) are correct, no bug here)
- A file *F2* is published to a repository *B* (its created / modified dates (created(F2) and modified(F2)) are correct, no bug here)

Since F1 was created before F2, we have:

{noformat}
created(F1) < created(F2)
{noformat}

- The file *F1* (from *A*) is copied to *B* as *F3* (here the bug occurs and we have created(F3) = created(F1)). The correct situation would be to have created(F3) > created(F2) > created(F1) because this represents the order of creation for those files.

If I run an AQL query against B listing all the files, sorted by *descending* created date, I end up with F2 as being the newest file because  created(F1) = created(F3) and created(F2) > created(F1)

You can see how this bug is problematic: created dates *CANNOT* be used to infer latest published files when files have been copied / moved.","23/Mar/20 10:02 AM;francois.ritaly;Note to the watchers:

{quote}
Thank you for the patience. I have further discussed internally on this and currently Artifactory behaves like an Linux based OS where created and modified time do not change upon a copy/move operation. So, the team might be considering adding a new field in the future for persisting the copy/move time but currently do not have such plans at the moment. I would recommend you to please watch the JIRA for further updates.
{quote}","23/Mar/20 10:22 AM;francois.ritaly;At this stage, the only workaround I can think of (the one we rolled out internally at Workday) consists in the following:
- Implement a custom AF plugin to set 2 custom properties (say ""meta.created"" and ""meta.modified"") for persisting the correct created and modified dates upon file creation, copy or move. 
- Install the plugin in AF and let it populate the 2 custom properties for new files published, copied or moved for a while. If necessary, roll out some automation to populate the custom properties for all the items already present in AF
- Change all your AQL queries (using the standard fields ""created"" and ""modified"") to also return the 2 new custom properties (be careful: when including custom properties in an AQL query, AF will *only* return the items which defines the properties ! There is a risk of regression here as querying the 2 properties will now return less records than before. That's why the 2 properties should ideally be populated for all the items in Artifactory, not just the new ones). If your code uses the ""List Files"" REST call to list items, the fix is a bit more convoluted: 1) either you convert your List Files call into an AQL query (see above) 2) or after issuing the List Files call, you need to run an extra AQL query just for retrieving the 2 custom properties and ""merge"" the result of both queries in-memory.

The workaround requires a lot of work...

I'm all hears if someone can come up with a simpler solution to this issue.","29/Jun/20 3:34 PM;francois.ritaly;Bumping this ticket because I recently hit this issue again and I hope JFrog will understand the huge pain this bug is causing to end users.

*What I want:* Identify the most recent file updated in a repository. 

Normally, I should be able to use an AQL query, list all the files by descending modified date, limit the result to one and (quickly and efficiently) get my answer.

However the files copied via the REST API don't have a reliable created / modified date (because of this bug). So, the workaround solution is to use a custom property to store the correct modified date (see previous comment). But this yields another problem: once you start using custom properties, you can no longer sort the AQL results (that's a limitation of AQL: sort doesn't work on custom properties). 

This means that the only way to identify the most recent modified file is to:
* List *ALL* the files from the repository with their custom properties
* Sort the files on the client-side
* Resolve the most recent file

We have repositories with A LOT of artifacts, having to do this just to identify the most recent file is ludicrous and extremely inefficient in terms of DB load, network traffic, CPU and memory consumption.

I hope JFrog will seriously consider fixing this bug because not being able to trust file's timestamps in Artifactory is just unacceptable.",

{noformat}
3. <bucket name>/filestore/<00 - ff>/<filename> - This will create a different prefix for /fiestore/00, /filestore/01, /filestore/02, ect... that means you will have 256 different prefixes and at the min of 3500 IOPS pre prefix you will get 896,000 IOPS per sec. {noformat}

 * multi-site topology for pull/push replication;
 * manage permission to allow users mananage their repository

the consolidation of deploy+cache permissions is extremely unhandy.

Assume, we create a pull-replicated repository set up, so on one site, there is local and multiple remotes, all contained in one user-facing virtual repository. Then, we create a permission target *pt1* that contains all of these repositories, and give manage permission to *user1*. 

*user1* wants to give *developer1* write access to the repository, and *reader1* read access to the repository. So he gives deploy/cache to *developer1* and read to *reader1*. It results in *reader1* not being able to get any artifacts that were not previously cached from remote repositories. In this case, either you give *reader1* deploy/cache (and he'll write stuff into your local repo, so it's really not a solution), or split permission target *pt1* into two permission targets, *pt2* containing only local repository and *pt3* containing related remotes.

Improve the Puppet Virtual metadata calculation mechanism,RTFACT-18934,70429,Improvement,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,andreik,andreik,08/Apr/19 10:45 AM,06/May/19 2:28 PM,18/Feb/21 8:56 AM,,6.9.0,,,,,Puppet,,,,,0,,,,,,,,"+*Summary:*+

Currently, the virtual repository metadata calculation partially relies on using an internal cache for an aggregated virtual repo metadata calculation.

This can cause some confusion and 404s responses for requests and successfully deployed Puppet modules (packages) to the underlying local repositories. Meaning requesting those will work *right after* deploying the packages to the local repositories, *however*, it will only work after the *internal virtual cache* has been timeout'ed and rebuilt. 

At the *worst case scenario* and with the set 30 minutes default, users can wait that period of time until a package is made downloadable from the virtual puppet repo.    

+*Mitigation:*+

Set *artifactory.puppet.reindex.period=1* under  $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc/artifactory.system.properties file and restart the instance.


+*Steps to reproduce this behavior:*+

1. Have a local and an aggregating virtual puppet repos.
2. Try to request the package below (still undeployed) from the puppet *virtual* repo - expect the expected 404:

*$ puppet module install  --module_repository=http://admin:password@localhost:8082/artifactory/api/puppet/puppet andreik-my_module --debug*

3. Use this script to build and deploy Puppet packages to puppet-local

{code}
RUN_TIMES=$1
i=0
mkdir my_module

while [ $i -lt $RUN_TIMES ]; do

  VERSION=$i
  echo $VERSION

cat << EOF > my_module/metadata.json
{""name"":""andreik-my_module"",""version"":""0.1.$VERSION"",""author"":""andreik"",""summary"":"""",""license"":""Apache-2.0"",""source"":"""",""dependencies"":[],""operatingsystem_support"":[{""operatingsystem"":""CentOS"",""operatingsystemrelease"":[""7""]},{""operatingsystem"":""OracleLinux"",""operatingsystemrelease"":[""7""]}],""requirements"":[{""name"":""puppet"",""version_requirement"":"">= 4.10.0 < 7.0.0""}],""pdk-version"":""1.9.0"",""template-url"":""file:///opt/puppetlabs/pdk/share/cache/pdk-templates.git"",""template-ref"":""1.9.0-0-g7281db5""}
EOF

  cd my_module
  echo 'yes' | pdk build
  curl -uadmin:password -XPUT -T pkg/andreik-my_module-0.1.$VERSION.tar.gz ""http://localhost:8082/artifactory/puppet-local/andreik-my_module-0.1.$VERSION.tar.gz""
  cd ..
  rm my_module/metadata.json

  i=`expr $i + 1`

done
{code}

4. Now, even though the package tar ball is available and visible from the virtual repo, it will only be available after 30 minutes from the time you have attempted step #2 above. *From the local puppet repo - it will available immediately*

Initially I was going to request the ability to update the text in the 'Set Me Up' guide ourselves, but really this would be more simply addressed if the text was updated for us by JFrog.

Currently there are two options presented by the Set Me Up page for npm:
 - npm login
 - basic authentication

At the moment, many users with ""@"" characters in their username will simply try the first option, see that it does not work, and request help / suggest the Set Me Up documentation is incorrect / broken.

It would be useful to add a 3rd option here:
 - npm login
 - using the /api/npm/auth endpoint (with ""curl -u <USERNAME>:<API_KEY> [https://url/artifactory/api/npm/auth/]"" to get a block to add directly into .npmrc)
 - basic authentication

Could the page be updated to explain that ""npm login"" doesn't work with usernames containing an ""@"" character, and to suggest and alternative (e.g. the /api/npm/auth endpoint) if it does. As Artifactory does know the username of the user, it could automatically determine that this is the case, though of course if the functionality should change in the future and allow ""@"" characters this functionality or advise should change with it.

For one thing, depending on the search, various artifacts can be mixed together in the search results, and the names of the artifacts are often truncated with an ellipsis ""..."" due to width constraints. This makes it difficult to tell which artifact each row describes. It would be much nicer if the results were grouped by groupId:artifactId (this is not possible in the UI right now, you can only manually group by either artifactId or by groupId). See [https://search.maven.org/] for an example.

Besides the fact that the UI doesn't know how to sort by version number, as described in https://www.jfrog.com/jira/browse/RTFACT-10694, there is also the problem that even if the relative sort order was correct, the user will still not necessarily be shown the item with the highest or lowest value for that column. It seems like this happens when there are large number of search results.

Expected results: When performing a search for a Maven Artifact, the results should be grouped by groupId:artifactId coordinate, and the highest version (according to [https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Version_Order_Specification] ) should be displayed prominently without additional user interaction. If the user has the option to sort by version, the UI should present the highest/lowest version (according to [https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Version_Order_Specification] ) from the entire contents of Artifactory, not an arbitrary/unpredictable/inscrutable subset of the contents.

 According to the Replication Topology whitepaper ([https://jfrog.com/whitepaper/replication-using-artifactory-to-manage-binaries-across-multi-site-topologies/]), push replication setups require multiple local repositories to handle the different incoming streams of data:

Artifactory A       Artifactory B

Repo A         ->     Repo A  | Virtual containing A and B
Repo B         <-     Repo B  |

Otherwise you get looping replication, which will cause deployments on one instance to constantly replicate in a loop.

As of Artifactory 6.6, Build information is kept in a special repository called ""*artifactory-build-info*"". In the past, there was a user plugin called [Build Sync |https://github.com/jfrog/artifactory-user-plugins/blob/master/build/buildSync/buildSync.groovy]that allowed Artifactory instances to replication build information.

This plugin is now deprecated, and the official way to replicate build info metadata is to use Repository Replications. However, repository replication do not support looping replications. There is also no way to create another artifactory-build-info repository to create a Mesh Topology setup.

There is no way to have a Mesh Topology for build info repositories in Artifactory yet.

 

Some possible solutions would be to allow the creation of Buildinfo repositories. Another solution would be to add a special replication setup for build info replications.

You can diagnose it in ""Test Artifact Path Resolution"". If you are using the Pro version you can create a custom layout to support it. It the FOSS version it is not allowed in the UI and you would need to ""hack it"" at the lower level. Alternatively, you could create an another proxy rewriting URL from [http://your.example.com/distributions/distributions-gradle-xxx.yyy|http://something/distributions/distributions-gradle-xxx.yyy] to [https://services.gradle.org/distributions/xxx.yyy] to match an existing layout.

 

Anyway, as the FOSS version of Artifactory already supports the Gradle plugins layout, therefor it's a natural counterpart to provide also an another layout to support Gradle distributions.

That's particularly bad when that remote is part of a virtual repo, as all requests to that virtual repo will wait until the connection to the remote server times out before they respond.

h2. How to reproduce

It's easy to reproduce the issue using toxy (https://github.com/h2non/toxy). All you need to do is point the proxy to another artifactory instance and set the latency high (eg. 1500ms, if that's your socket timeout configuration in your remote repo). This is what my toxy configuration looks like:

{code}
const toxy = require('toxy')

const proxy = toxy()
const rules = proxy.rules
const poisons = proxy.poisons

proxy
  .all('/*')
  .poison(poisons.slowRead({ chunk: 1, threshold: 2000 }))
  .poison(toxy.poisons.latency(1500))
  .withRule(rules.method('GET'))
  .forward('http://artifactory2:8081')

proxy.listen(3000)
console.log('Server listening on port:', 3000)
{code}

I've set a test virtual repo containing a local repo and a remote pointing to http://artifactory2:3000 (I bound the proxy locally on that port). After doing that this curl would always take more than 1.5s:

{code}time curl http://artifactory/artifactory/api/pypi/test/simple/{code}

Artifactory configuration:

{code}
$ curl http://artifactory/artifactory/api/repositories/test
{
  ""key"" : ""test"",
  ""packageType"" : ""pypi"",
  ""description"" : """",
  ""repositories"" : [ ""local-python"", ""remote-python"" ],
  ""rclass"" : ""virtual""
}
$ curl http://artifactory/artifactory/api/repositories/remote-python
{
  ""key"" : ""remote-python"",
  ""packageType"" : ""pypi"",
  ""description"" : """",
  ""url"" : ""http://artifactory2:3000/artifactory/pypi/api/local-python/"",
  ""rclass"" : ""remote""
}

Admins of our service currently have to field all requests for re-indexing as normal users, even if they are write members of their repository, cannot do it.

Once a user has logged in via SAML, their Profile page does not require a password to unlock in order to view or change the API key (because Artifactory has no way of validating the password), so I cannot think of a security reason why a user would not be able to populate their API key in the 'Set Me Up' tool

We specifically don't want users to use their password or encrypted password when authenticating via the command line, so ideally the current 'USERNAME:PASSWORD' instructions in the default text could be replaced by 'USERNAME:AUTH', with 'AUTH' being replaced by their API key (encoded as appropriate for tools such as npm) when they chose to do so. Perhaps the user would have the option to add their password, encrypted password or API key (and admins could switch off any of these) - so for us we'd only allow an API key to be added (if present of course).

Steps to Reproduce:
 # Setup Artifactory with Nginx as reverse proxy without the context /artifactory
 # Remove the proxy_set_header    X-Artifactory-Override-Base-Url from the Nginx 
 # In Artifactory set the custom base URL in the General settings which is responsible for generating the links in set me up and other redirects
 # The custom base URL is set to just http://<server_name> without the /artifactory context
 # Navigate to http://<server_name>/api/pypi/pypi-remote/simple/accc/ and you will notice that you are redirected to http://<server_name>/artifactory/api/pypi/pypi-remote/simple/accc/. This results in 404 error due to the invalid /artifactory context being added to the URL redirect.

The workaround is to set the ""proxy_set_header    X-Artifactory-Override-Base-Url"" in nginx with the Artifactory URL. This will fix the problem, but this should not be required when you have set a valid custom base URL in Artifactory. 

In the previous  version  (6.5.13) even without ""proxy_set_header    X-Artifactory-Override-Base-Url"" in nginx, the redirect was working as expected when visiting the pypi remote URL's  and the /artifactory context was not being added during pypi remote URL redirects.

We understand how we could publish libraries used in building our executable up to Conan and our pdb files separately to a symbol server accessible to VisualStudio.

However, given space constraints, we must manage the garbage collection of old library builds once we become certain they are no longer needed.

If we store .pdb files to a separate symbol server, then whatever lifecycle and deprecation management we decide on for Conan packages must be duplicated for the management of the symbol server pdbs.

If instead we could simply publish the pdb and lib files in the same Conan package, publish them to Artifactory and aim Visual Studio at the artifactory conan repo as a Symbol Server, we could manage those artifacts together.

Can we please request a Conan/Artifactory integration enhancement that would allow .pdb files published within Conan packages to be transparently available as if it were a Symbol Server, using the usual hash query mechanism implemented by Symbol Servers [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1419347/microsoft-symbol-server-local-cache-hash-algorithm] ?

we are using Artifactory for quite a while now and discovered that many REST API calls are designed to be used in a blocking way. For example the delete item operation of the REST API can consume a bit more time, if a very large tree has to be deleted. Another example is triggering the garbage collection leads to an API call that can take quite a while; In this case the UI is blocked until the call is finished. Both operation can easily lead to timeouts in various places.

In my eyes both operations can be considered to trigger long running or delayed executed processes. Therefore I would expect them to be implemented or at least be available in an asynchronous fashion. 

My proposal to avoid these issues:

Make every (Web) REST-API that cannot be expected to respond fast, because it's a heavy operation/process or the duration depends on the underlying data, available as asynchronous operation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|hzyer3:",,,,,,,UNCOVERED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Artifactory,,,,,,,100.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The backup is done via artifactory on a daily basis.
The backup is done on a windows file share and the directories and files will get the permissions of the file share. The permission do differ from the local file system.

During the restore via artifactory files are copied to the local windows file system with the permissions of the share. This results in an error because the user ""Local System Account"" doesn't have permissions on the windows file share.

We found that uploading a package to a repository, then uploading a package by the same name into another repository creates ambiguity when the two repositories are or will be related in a virtual relationship.  The collision in package names happened between 2 local physical repos (LOCAL-BUSINESS-UNIT and LOCAL-ENTERPRISE-WIDE-REPO) of a business unit virtual repo (BUSINESS-UNIT-REPO).  In another scenario uploading a remote package to a local repository causes a collision, too.

This would result in 
* potential package duplication,
* malicious local replacements of remote packages,
* unexpected authentication errors when downloading a remote package name from the virtual repository and jFrog resolving it to a local authenticated copy.

 * Ever since then, attempts to download xunit from NUGETREPO (a virtual repo that has a nuget-remote component pointing to the Microsoft gallery) fail using nuget.exe (but curl works).  I used a nuget.exe v. 4.9.4.5839 and a clean nuget.config such as the following,

{{packages}} to resolve relative references in .csproj files. I purged both {{d:\packages}} and {{%userprofile%\.nuget\packages}} before each nuget restore invokation.

 * The {{nuget restore -configfile nuget.config}} command *succeeded only after deleting the password-protected xunit packages from NUGETREPO-local* (using curl -X DELETE -u 'USER:ENCRYPTEDPASS' ...).
 * I suppose nuget.exe has a complicated check of the package availability that resulted in nuget.exe displaying a 403 Forbidden message followed by prompting for username and password.
 * To further complicate the picture, our NUGETREPO includes {{nuget}} which in turn combines a {{nuget-local}} and a {{nuget-remote}} repository, with {{xunit}} packages seen in {{nuget-local}} against expectation (these can be downloaded without credentials and with any other credential).","05/Sep/19 1:29 AM;ilguiz_latypov;I reproduced today's issue (and it may be triggered by the overlap of packages contained both in the protected and unprotected repos).  For this I uploaded an external package to a local repo again and referred to it from a dependent project's packages.config.

Perhaps this ambiguity (triggered by the triplicate store of an external package) triggered nuget.exe into the anonymous download mode.  I submitted the related issue with NuGet, https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/8551","10/Dec/19 10:28 AM;ilguiz_latypov;Another blunder was found today thanks to a meticulous developer.  A rogue Maven upload of build result into Artifactory's local repo under the group and artifact IDs of a well-known remote dependency (commons-collection) resulted in that upload overriding resolution of the remote dependency with the local one.

If this override is by design, JFrog should have a big red page or section in its web interface displaying all current overrides.  I doubt we have resources to separate resolution of remote and local dependencies by their repo names.

Oh and whoever decided to put ""leap.jfrog.com"" banners after couple minutes of browing an issue, this made even adding this comment a hurdle.  Please remove the banner logic and start working on this issue.","09/Mar/20 11:43 PM;ilguiz_latypov;Ping!  Just saying we had another accidental upload overriding maven-clean-plugin.  Does Artifactory have an option to prioritize external dependencies over internal ones?  We would only need to make a few proprietary external packages available via a local upload, so the option and a way to prescribe exceptions to the option would be awesome.","10/Feb/21 10:34 AM;ilguiz_latypov;{quote}
JFrog is reportedly aware of the issue, but has been treating its possible fix as a “feature request” with no ETA in sight

 * at the time of improper publishing by poorly configured enterprise scripts and
 * at the time of improper use (when Artifactory clients download a package whose versions span across local and remote repositories).

Artifactory could maintain a list of compromised package names (by repo type) to speed up the checks at the time of improper use.  The list can be updated by Artifactory's executing both

 * the periodic remote repo refreshes complemented with checks against local repos.

Because of how docker filesystem layers work, this duplicates the artifactory.war file in the resulting image.

it would be nice if we had a way to include a folder or list of jars into the webapp's core classpath, without updating the war file burned into the image

However, with the above setup, it is being made as:

-there is a redirect from a 30x response (possibly from https to http or elsewhere), which causes the POST to be redirected to a GET (since you can't redirect a POST request)

The Nessus link for the vulnerability is [https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/12085.] The recommended remediation - https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Securing_tomcat.

# chmod -R 400 conf 

# chmod -R 300 /var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/logs/catalina

# rm -rf org 

# cd /opt/jfrog/artifactory/tomcat/conf

Steps to reproduce :

We need two artifactory instances with different license, to represent two different regions A and B.

+*1. Installation:*+

In Region A:

a. Installed Artifactory v6.x
 b. Created a local repository: art1-docker-local-repodev
 c. Created a local repository: art1-docker-local-repotest

In Region B:

a. Installed Artifactory v6.x
 b. Created a local repository: art2-docker-local-repodev
 c. Created a local repository: art2-docker-local-repotest

*+2. Repository Event Based Replication(Push) setup:+*

From Region A (art1-docker-local-repodev) --> to Region B (art2-docker-local-repodev)
 From Region B(art2-docker-local-repotest) --> to Region A(art1-docker-local-repotest)

+*3. Initiated a deploy and then a copy:*+

a. Deploy artifacts to Region A (art1-docker-local-repodev), this triggers replication to art2-docker-local-repodev in Region B.
 b. In Region B, copied the artifacts, by using the storage plugin as mentioned in the wiki page : [https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/User+Plugins#UserPlugins-Storage] 

Here is the plugin code used : 

_import org.artifactory.repo.RepoPathFactory_

_storage {_
 _afterCreate { item ->_
 _if (""art2-docker-local-repodev"".equals(item.getRepoKey())) {_
 _def fromRepoPath = RepoPathFactory.create(item.getRepoKey(), item.repoPath.path)_
 _def toRepoPath = RepoPathFactory.create(""art2-docker-local-repotest"", item.repoPath.path)_

_log.error(""[Copy Test] Copying $fromRepoPath to $toRepoPath"")_
 _repositories.copy(fromRepoPath, toRepoPath)_
 _}_
 _}_
_}_


 c. This gives an error saying ""Refusing to queue replication event.... the target server...is equal to one of the origin"" and fails to trigger a replication from Region B art2-docker-local-repotest to Region A art1-docker-local-repotest. This should have worked as the repositories are different. 

 

Here's the corresponding log entry:

*2018-10-19 21:14:37,751 [http-nio-8081-exec-8] [DEBUG] (o.a.a.r.c.ReplicationServiceImpl:314) - Refusing to queue replication event for 'art2-docker-local-repotest:replication-test.rtf': the target server '7763f1f3d6fafb93:373c9a14:1668cfdcf37:-8000' is equal to one of the origin '[7763f1f3d6fafb93:373c9a14:1668cfdcf37:-8000, 83e357a425d9b387:51be598b:1668cffc856:-8000]' of this event.*

Note: The copy plugin works as tested in this use case :

Deploy a file to Region B (art2-docker-local-repodev) , this triggers the copy plugin and creates a copy in Region B (art2-docker-local-repotest), which in turn triggers the event replication and replicates the file to Region A(art1-docker-local-repotest).

The query will always wait for the SUM to complete even if the COUNT was a O(1) lookup in a cache.

I would suggest to make the COUNT query together with the inital page request since it should be constant with a correctly indexed table.

Let SUM queries be user initiated for both repo sub-items and the storage summary page. Or for that matter, keep a separate field in the DB for repo sizes.

 

The query for the storage page and takes a long time to return for large repositories.

IE, if a local repository is configured to replicate to another local repository of the same Artifactory, the event based replication does not work, due to the logic of preventing replication loop. However for various use cases, replication locally is really needed and it should not a risk of replication loop at all.

How to reproduce this limitation:
 * Set up an HA artifactory with two backends.
 * Create two local repo ext-snapshot-local, and ext-snapshot-rep-local
 * Set up replication from ext-snapshot-local, to  [http://localhost:8081/artifactory/ext-snapshot-rep-local,] and enable event based replication.
 * Deploy a file to ext-snapshot-local
 * We can not see the file replicated to ext-snapshot-rep-local, until cron based replication kicks in.

If the replication target is configured as ""https://<dns>/artifactory/ext-snapshot-rep-local"", then the event based replication some time works but some time not, depending on which backend the https front-end route the request to.

 

On the other hand, the detection of replication loop seems to be based on server ID (one ID per backend) but not the Artifactory instance ID, and do not consider the name of the repository.

The audit.log appears to be focused on logging security events based upon identifying those users that make changes to the security configuration of an Artifactory instance.  It does not log the authorization event in which I am interested; which is, ""Artifactory authorizes user via permission target group AD lookup"".  Please talk to David Xu if you require additional clarification or context.  I understand that there may be an LDAP logger that can be applied to capture this info but it is also very resource intensive.  Maybe this logger could be modified to provide a more narrower focus on end user group authentication / authorization actions only?

Fix would still be nice for checking both decoded and encoded when doing a HEAD request.

We've tried to reach out to NPMJS directly with no success. More of an issue on NPMJS but since the NPM client doesn't (seem) to see this issue, perhaps its something we can fix on our end.

We've (re)discovered a issue, with HEAD/GET requests, where 5 packages (that we know of) will 404 when Artifactory reaches out to get it's metadata from registry.npmjs.org: 
@babel/helper-builder-react-jsx
@babel/plugin-syntax-jsx
@apollographql/graphql-playground-html
@reach/router
@pm2/io

e.g. trying to hit registry.npmjs.org/@pm2/io will fail (404). If we encode the last slash, to registry.npmjs.org/@pm2%2fio, then it loads properly. A working package will work with the decoded slash, e.g: registry.npmjs.org/@angular/core

The packages all exist on NPMJS, *artifactory only checks the decoded slash*, perhaps we can have it check BOTH registry.npmjs.org/@pm2/io and registry.npmjs.org/@pm2%2fio?

We currently have 2 workarounds:
Add package to local
Bypass HEAD requests

This proves to be more of an impact the larger the artifact path is.

Also, there are duplicate ""select *"" queries. In the attached jdbc logger, search for:

Artifactory version-- 6.1.0

Due to this some cran dependency management tools like ""packrat"" are unable to install packages when they are pointing to the cran local repo in Artifactory. The cran metadata in cran local repo should be similar to the cran remote.

https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/

The same dependency management tool ""packrat"" is able to install cran packages if it is pointing to a remote cran repo in Artifactory.

For example here is the cran remote endpoint where the packages exist [https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/]

If you go to the following endpoint you will find some additional metadata files in the cran remote which don't exist in a cran local repo [https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Meta/]

There is also this Archive folder in cran remote that contains older versions of the packages [https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/]

In our cran local repos, we see the ARCHIVE folder populated in this form...

   Archive/\{package}/\{version}/\{package}_\{version}

Example:

   cran-release-local/src/contrib/Archive/analyzer/1.0.0/analyzer_1.0.0.tar.gz

 

...rather than according to the layout we see at the remote sites...

   Archive/\{package}/\{package}_\{version}

I believe these simple steps will allow you to test publishing multiple versions of a well-formed R package (Without you needing to create an R package). This should help validate the issues discussed in this ticket.


First, GET 2 versions of the ""random"" package from the cran.r-project.org mirror 
 https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/random/

curl https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/random/random_0.1.0.tar.gz -o /tmp/random_0.1.0.tar.gz

curl https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/random/random_0.1.2.tar.gz -o /tmp/random_0.1.2.tar.gz


Then, PUT the first package file to your local CRAN-type repo:

curl -uadmin:password -X PUT ""http://localhost/artifactory/cran-local/src/contrib/random_0.1.0.tar.gz"" -T /tmp/random_0.1.0.tar.gz

>>> Expect to see cran-local:src/contrib/PACKAGES.gz file and cran-local:src/contrib/META folder and files within

Now to validate Archive folder location, PUT the second version of the package file:

curl -uadmin:password -X PUT ""http://localhost/artifactory/cran-local/src/contrib/random_0.1.2.tar.gz"" -T /tmp/random_0.1.2.tar.gz

Once they had removed the affected packages and ensured the site credentials were being sent to was shut down, they decided to revoke all npm tokens created before the ""all clear"". This meant that any users who had proactively recycled their tokens in response to the situation wouldn't have to go through the pain of having them revoked again.

When we decided to follow npm's example, we only had the choice to revoke *all* API keys, not just those created before a certain time. This is because the Artifactory Rest API for revoking all API keys ([https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-RevokeAllAPIKeys)] has no 'createdBefore' field. In fact, the underlying database does not even store when the key was created. This meant that users who were already proactive in protecting their credentials had to have their access revoked unnecessarily.

Here's an example entry from ""access_users_custom_data"" (user_id, prop_key, prop_value) :
|1007|apiKey|JE8L2A...|


In order to be able to delete all keys older than a certain point via the API, the database would need to be extended to have a 'time_created' property for API keys (if other entries in access_users_custom_data don't need this access_users_credentials could be separated out until a unique table), and the API would need extending to allow parameters to be given 

For this functionality to be useful to us we would also need to be able to exclude certain known-good users from the revocation (e.g. createdBefore x, excludeUsers list,y )

Until this is implemented we've had to manually get a list of users together and run the single-user API key delete call in a loop, which is hardly ideal, and completely misses the ability to filter by date created.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|hzxg1r:",,,,,,,UNCOVERED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Artifactory,,,,,,,100.0,,,,,,,,,,,,"01/Mar/19 3:47 PM;czardis;In lieu of a full implementation of this issue, it would be desirable to have a queryable field in the database showing the API key's creation date - that way we can conduct our own searches.

Build dependency scopes table should support more than 4000 characters as CLOB,RTFACT-17070,59524,Improvement,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,davidx,davidx,03/Jul/18 6:39 PM,17/Jul/18 11:44 PM,18/Feb/21 8:56 AM,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,"Currently, the Build dependency scopes is a VARCHAR2 data type and as such is limited to 4000 characters.  This can cause certain large builds (android builds spanning multiple OSs) to fail if the dependency scopes exceed 4000 characters.

A workaround is to change the table to a CLOB datatype, which can store significantly longer strings and allows the build to complete.  However, implementing this workaround generates:

_ORA-00932: inconsistent datatypes: expected - got CLOB_

This is caused by this statement:

_SELECT distinct build_dependencies.dependency_name_id as id,build_dependencies.dependency_type as type,build_dependencies.dependency_scopes as scope,build_dependencies.sha1 FROM build_dependencies_
_left join build_modules on build_modules.module_id=build_dependencies.module_id_
_left join builds on  build_modules.build_id = builds.build_id_

Specfically the *distinct* is incompatible with CLOB and causes this error.  Removing it from the statement fixes this issue.

The improvement request is:
 # Support build dependency scopes exceeding 4k characters (likely as CLOB)
 # Support CLOB datatypes

Improve LDAP reliability by retrying if the connection fails,RTFACT-16718,57506,Improvement,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,ken.martindale,ken.martindale,15/May/18 5:46 PM,16/Mar/20 3:21 PM,18/Feb/21 8:56 AM,,5.10.0,5.11.0,5.9.0,,,LDAP,,,,,4,artifactory,Authentication,HA,LDAP,,,,"# When the configuration specifies an LDAP URL that uses a DNS name with multiple IP addresses, continue trying the other IPs if the first one fails or times out, instead of simply denying access (which causes builds to fail).
 # Even if the LDAP URL uses a DNS name with only one IP address, it would still be helpful to retry the connection in case of a temporary network issue or LDAP server performance problem.  Ideally the timeout/retry behavior would be configurable.

Example:

ldap://ldap.americas.mycompany.com:389

Where DNS name ldap.americas.mycompany.com returns multiple IP addresses like:

192.168.23.56

192.168.11.101

192.168.40.99

Currently, Artifactory will try to connect to the first IP, but if that LDAP server is down, unresponsive, or unreachable, it appears that the authentication request is failed right away without retrying, even if the other LDAP server IPs are alive and well.  This will typically result in seemingly random build failures when one of the LDAP servers is offline.  For instance: [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-deploy-plugin:2.7:deploy (default-deploy) on project

Reliability could be improved by trying, in sequence, each of the IP addresses returned by DNS until a responsive server is found, and/or including a configurable retry/timeout mechanism.

Granted, there are some potential workarounds, such as creating a separate LDAP configuration in Artifactory for each LDAP server IP, or using a GSLB, or a floating IP for LDAP, but many other tools and services automatically try to connect to each IP returned by DNS so that is the behavior that many users expect.

After the huge cleanup was done I had to remove the setting again and restart artifactory once again.

But it would make sense to have a header or a query parameter on the DELETE call which instructs Artifactory to not trigger a metadata recalculation on this call.

 * sending of e-mail notifications to users
 * standard replication
 * security and build replication based on plugins (the configuration also gets restored with production values)

We know this is already possible through the admin UI or API, but there is always a chance that something already starts at the moment the server is started and before you can disable it there.

The automation is aware that the instance being installed is in test, set a property to run the Artifactory in test mode and all replication, e-mails etc are disabled from the start.

When talking to our infrastructure department at our company they can help us with taking block snapshots very quick, but we need to ensure that no existing writing is in progress when we perform this to ensure that the backups are perfectly valid.

Hi,

it seems that the Artifactory docker image has problems connecting to Xray when Let's Encrypt certifaces are used.

Both Artifactory and Xray are running in a Kubernetes cluster and are available at https URLs with valid Let's Encrypt certs.

When, in Xray, I set the Base URL to [http://|http://.../]xray.mydomain the conenction to Artifactory works fine.

When I set the Base URL to [https://|https://.../]xray.mydomain the connection fails with this error message in the Artifactory logs:
{code:java}
Failed to propagate event to xray server at 'https://xray.mydomain' : sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target.{code}
 

That's propably because of the java version used in the Artifactory docker image:
{code:java}
/docker-java-home/bin/java -version openjdk version ""1.8.0_131""{code}
 

I ran a small java test script in the container to verify this. The script just calls the xray https URL and throws this error:

I don't see importing the missing CA certs into the keystore as an option.
Let's encrypt certs are not something exceptional anymore, but state of the art. I think that any software should support them by now.

In order to achieve this, you can use *Backups*. In the UI, go to the Admin module > Backups. 
When creating a backup, check 'Incremental' - (taken from the [Artifactory User Guide|https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Managing+Backups#ManagingBackups-CompleteSystemBackup]) When set, this backup should be incremental. In this case, only changes from the previous run will be backed up, so the process is very fast.
The backup directory name will be called current (as opposed to using the timestamp)
The backup files can be used by any incremental file-system based backup utility (such as rsync).

You can then use this export when importing on the intranet Artifactory instance. 

Hope that helps. ",,,,,,,

In this request, comes a new requirement for using this mechanism for updating existing configurations and applying them by restarting the Docker container.
Technically, this is a simple change in sources - just run *addExtraConfFiles* every time the container starts.
The implication of such a change will be that changes made directly to files under *ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc* might be overwritten by a restart of the container.

There should be an option to replicate these files. 

The general use case would be for generic repositories being used as an archival file storage system (such as using it instead of a NAS share). In that case maven-metadata.xml is just an arbitrary file that happens to have semantical meaning attached to its name for maven artifacts. If I had some arbitrary file storage that I threw my files on to I would expect it to work the same in artifactory as well. They should not disappear on me based on the artifactory site that I am downloading from.

As a concrete example consider using artifactory as the storage system for archiving portions of Jenkins build workspaces. This could happen if workspaces need to be passed between jobs as well as for debugging purposes. It's not ideal and but it happens. If the workspace contained some maven-metadata.xml file it would be awkward if the user/job consuming the workspace behaves differently based on where it is located due to other locations missing files. We are not in this situation today but we do have a backlog item to investigate using artifactory as a generic file store as the default Jenkins mechanism stores the files on disk which take a lot of space and slow the system down.

Since this could potentially break people that erroneously use generic or other repository types for maven artifacts instead of the maven type any change would have to be a configurable option system level or the repository level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|hzwdsf:",,,,,,,UNCOVERED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,100.0,,,,,,,,,,,,"16/Apr/19 10:34 AM;akm022;Possibly related to RTFACT-18035.",,,,,,,

Checking inside the Jfrog Artifactory RPM file shows that all the files and directories permissions are like 0775 and 0664 or even more world-readable. Maybe it is a good idea to tighten the permissions a little bit, because I really don't see any reason why the files permissions should be so wide-open for all users.

This then cause all the typical downstream consequences of what happens when two different artifacts are published under the same name and version. This issue was referenced:

[https://github.com/pypa/twine/pull/363]

Twine has a ""--skip-existing"" flag, but it doesn't work unless Delete/Overwrite is disabled for the calling user. This means that in order for these users to work properly, they need to lose their Delete/Overwrite. The Overwrite isn't a concern in this case, but the Delete is. Now, they are no longer able to clean up old artifacts.

From a security standpoint only - Delete/Overwrite being one permission has merit. It's simple.

From an actual user workflow perspective, however, there are many different use cases where we might want to enforce that the user is only allowed to Delete and not Overwrite, or only allowed to Overwrite but not Delete. This isn't a security problem, but it is a process enforcement problem. Ensuring that users (and the tools they invoke) do the right thing.

Please separate these permissions.

Enforce build number consistency when uploading snapshot POMs via a Virtual repo,RTFACT-14962,46971,Improvement,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,uriahl,uriahl,17/Sep/17 12:00 PM,26/Sep/17 3:24 PM,18/Feb/21 8:56 AM,,,,,,,Maven,,,,,2,,,,,,,,"When directly deploying POM files via virtual repo (with a Default Deployment Repo), a situation may occur where different versions of the same snapshot version is contained within different repos under the corresponding virtual repo, i.e:

└── virtual 
        ├── local1 .    - latest snapshot version is 1 (e.g. artifactId-2.1.0--20170830.165330-1.pom)
        └── local2 .    - latest snapshot version is 3 (e.g. artifactId-2.1.0--20170830.165330-3.pom)

Notice how local2 contains a more recent build number than local1 (3 vs. 1). When the maven client deploys (say to a virtual repo), it gets the maven-metadata.xml first, figures out which version is the latest, and then increments it. In other words Maven produces a valid build number since it sends an explicit unique snapshot path and doesn't rely on artifactory to generate it.  In this case, if the next deployment goes to local1, the next build number would still be *4*, which is good.

However, when deploying a snapshot POM to the same virtual repo using the SNAPSHOT keyword (i.e ""artifactId-<2.1.0>-SNAPSHOT"") via the REST API, Artifactory would increment the build number according to the last build number that exists on the local repo where the POM is deployed to, so using the above example, the build number would be 2. This behavior is expected and produces consistent build numbers when deploying directly to a local repo, however, since virtual repos are used nowadays for both deployments and resolution, deploying to a virtual repo should produce consistent build numbers too - i.e the REST should mimic the maven client behavior. 

A possible workaround would be changing the default snapshot version comparator to the TimestampSnapshotComparator which compares snapshot versions based on their timestamp rather than the build number, so even an inconsistent build number won't prevent resolution of the ""latest"" deployed POM -

artifactory.mvn.metadataSnapshotComparatorFqn=org.artifactory.maven.snapshot.TimestampSnapshotComparator

If you delete a parent folder in the view, it will delete folders and item within the view that match the search, as well as other items or folders NOT in the view that you don't want to be deleted.

For example, you have a ""parent"" folder in a search stash results view, with folders ""1"" and ""2"", in which only the ""1"" folder shows up in the stash view. In this situation, you only want the ""1"" folder to be deleted. However, if you delete the ""parent"" folder, both folder ""1"" and ""2"" will be deleted, even when only the ""1"" folder is showing up in the stash view and you want to keep the ""2"" folder. Deleting the ""parent"" folder should only delete the ""1"" folder which is present in the view, not the ""2"" folder as well since( the ""2"" folder isn't in the stash view).

To test:
-Create debian local repo
-deploy a file into /pool/c/test1/file1
-deploy a file into /pool/c/test2/file2
-Do a quick search for file1, and notice that pool/c/test1/file1 will be in the results

I had a similar issue and this is the information I have found out so far

With the installation of JFrog Artifactory, we also get artifactory.war in a path */artifactory/webapps/artifactory.war* similar to that

This is the war file that gets deployed onto Tomcat and serves as UI for us.

The war file has many packages jar files in them. One of them is *artifactory-core-6.5.9.jar*

The core jar file has the following class file in it

org/artifactory/repo/service/RepositoryServiceImpl.class

I decompiled the class file and noticed the following

public BasicStatusHolder undeploy(RepoPath repoPath, boolean calcMavenMetadata, boolean pruneEmptyFolders) {
      String repoKey = repoPath.getRepoKey();
      StoringRepo storingRepo = this.storingRepositoryByKey(repoKey);
      BasicStatusHolder statusHolder = new BasicStatusHolder();
      if (storingRepo == null) {
         statusHolder.error(""Could find storing repository by key '"" + repoKey + ""'"", log);
         return statusHolder;
      } else {
         PathDeletionContext pathDeletionContext = (new org.artifactory.repo.local.PathDeletionContext.Builder(storingRepo, repoPath.getPath(), statusHolder)).assertOverwrite(false).build();
         this.assertDelete(pathDeletionContext);
         if (!statusHolder.isError()) {
            try {
               storingRepo.undeploy((new DeleteContext(repoPath)).calculateMavenMetadata(calcMavenMetadata));
            } catch (CancelException var9) {
              {color:#d04437} *statusHolder.error(""Undeploy was canceled by user plugin"", var9.getErrorCode(), var9, log);*{color}
            }
         }

         if (pruneEmptyFolders && !repoPath.isRoot()) {
            this.pruneService.prune(repoPath.getParent());
         }

         return statusHolder;
      }
   }

 

As you can see, Undeploy was cancelled by user plugin is hardcoded in the error handling - which comes by default with the installtion of Artifactory.

Jfrog will need to update this in one of the releases, such that our custom message will be used instead of the default one

In this set-up, Tomcat is linked from /var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/tomcat to /opt/jfrog/artifactory/tomcat.

Using a standard install for a single service server, I kept /opt fairly small (6gb). This should be fine for installation and upgrade of Artifactory. As we're testing, a user attempted to upload a large .tar.gz file via the UI (1.6gb). this failed due to file size limitations in the UI. I advised to upload using curl and the API. This also failed.

Checking, I saw that /opt was full. Further analysis showed MIMEXXX.txt files in /opt/jfrog/artifactory/tomcat/temp. These appear to be created during transactions. These appear to clean-up automatically, however, when the disk becomes full, clean-up does not occur.

I propose Artifactory use a more standard Linux install set-up. large transient files should be kept in /var or /tmp. This will protect users from large transaction files filling /opt

Also, I would suggest documenting this in the meantime. I have used a workaround of creating a symlink from /opt/jfrog/artifactory/tomcat/temp -> /var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/tmp/tomcat/.

My case is I have more than 60 Docker services with each having production and development builds, and each one having multiple tags (e.g. docker.myregistry.com/svc1/development:tag1). Recently I faced with the issue that I was keeping too much unique tags and I ran out of disk space. So I changed it to a lower count and I expected Artifactory to start deleting the oldest tags. As it doesn't I must delete my 5 oldest tags manually (about 60*2*5 times of right-click, delete, yes), or I must wait for a deploy to trigger the cleanup. But I can't deploy, as I don't have any disk space left.","28/Jan/20 10:09 AM;erezinchy;Hi,

yes, would be good to have such feature. It makes sense that if you reduce the number of unique tags, it should kick of the cleanup process.

In addition, this configuration could be useless :

This may take seconds to minutes to hours. This will also exceed any reasonable proxy timeout period and most builds are likely to interpret the failed call as a build failure.

This problem is exacerbated by the fact that overlapping builds (attempting to deploy a new build while another is being deployed) can cause [issues such as 500s|https://www.jfrog.com/jira/browse/HAP-488].

The first deployment (second entry in the log) takes 123 seconds to complete (due to build deletion) and causes the later deployment to fail with 500.

The bulk operations would accept multiple properties and use a single batched DB call on the back end to execute the operation.

The current behavior is to make one call per property per file/folder.  For the REST API, CRUD for a single property is dwarfed by the HTTP transaction overhead.  This overhead grows intolerable the more properties that are being operated on.

The repositories.setProperty* PAPI doesn't suffer from the same HTTP overhead but does likewise create & commit a DB transaction per property.  This could be significantly improved with a single batch DB update within a single transaction for all properties and files.

This feature would significantly improve the performance of recursive CRUD operations.  The current behavior is to recursively apply the CRUD operation per property per file/folder.  Collecting all the properties & files/folders and performing one large bulk CRUD backed by one large batched DB operation would significantly improve performance.

Bulk property CRUD operations backed by single batched DB call would also guarantee atomicity.  When each property CRUD operation is in an independent transaction, it is possible for some operations to succeed and others to fail leaving the end state inconsistent across files/folders.  If the CRUD operation across properties, files, & folders was in a single DB transaction, then the CRUD operation would be guaranteed to be atomic leaving the state of the properties across all impacted files/folders consistent, i.e., either it worked for all of them or it didn't work for any of them.


The specific use case that highlighted this opportunity for improvement is where a user plugin adds 6-10 properties each time deployment into an environment occurs.  To avoid the up to 10 seconds overhead required with the REST API due to HTTP overhead, you have to create a user plugin wrapping the property creation.  Over time, properties accumulate resulting in hundreds of properties on a single file.  Trying to delete these properties can take minutes because each property is its own operation/transaction.  This is compounded when trying to do this recursively for folders - especially when the folder is the root of the repository.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|hzrslz:",,,,,,,UNCOVERED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"09/Jun/16 12:17 PM;mmaxey;This issue is compounded by RTFACT-9181.",,,,,,,

Developers -> Development Team Leaders -> Information Services -> Security Steering Committee

We desire fine-grained control over which artifacts are available in each repository, so we make heavy use of the include/exclude rules.

The plan was for Team Leaders to have Manage rights to their repositories, to give them permission to modify include/exclude rules just for the repositories under their control.  Thus, when a Developer requires access to a new artifact, they lodge a request with the Team Leader.  The Team Leader confirms compatible licensing, checks for known vulnerabilities, and creates the appropriate Include rule.

This would leave Information Services as the only Admins on Artifactory, who would then be in control of user access configuration and log monitoring.  Information Services then reports to the Security Steering Committee.  This gives a level of oversight and governance, without incurring undue delays for the developers, and without granting Admin rights unnecessarily.

Unfortunately, the ""Manage"" rights on a repository don't allow a repository manager the ability to control the include/exclude rules: these can only be controlled by an Admin user, which leaves us needing to add ALL our Team Leaders as Admins on our Artifactory instance.

I propose that ""Manage"" rights on a repository should allow the Managers access to change these Include/Exclude rules.",Debian 8.3 / Artifactory Pro,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|hzrsen:",,,,,,,UNCOVERED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the current implementation it is possible to delegate a authentication responsibility to a SAML IdP, but if Artifactory is part of single sign on session where other applications are in, and the session is configured to logout out all the application in that session, it needs to send a SAML logout request to all of them.

Currently SAML logout is supported if initiated on Artifactory and the logout flow is delegate to the IdP.

My improvement request is that:

1) Artifactory be able to receive a SAML logout request from the IdP and finish the current user session.

1a) Reply to the IdP with a SAML Logout Response

2) On SAML logout initiated by the Artifactory, that it be able to process the SAML Logout response from the IdP when it does not take over the logout flow.

Debian repos don't recalculate metadata upon replication,RTFACT-10351,34220,Improvement,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,mikem,mikem,24/May/16 11:33 PM,04/Jan/21 5:10 PM,18/Feb/21 8:56 AM,,4.1.3,4.3.2,4.7.7,4.8.0,,Debian,Replication,,,,0,artifactory,,,,,,,"When .deb artifacts are replicated to a Debian repository, the destination repo doesn't calculate metadata. If metadata is replicated along with the artifact, the replicated metadata is kept at the destination. If metadata is not replicated, no metadata is generated. A debug message is logged on the destination: ""Skipping debian calculation: Insufficient Properties {}.""

This behavior was reproduced with replications from an Artifactory 4.1.3 instance to a 4.3.2 instance, from 4.3.2 to 4.7.7, and from 4.8.0 to 4.8.0.

To reproduce (replication from [src] -> [dest]):
-----------------------------------------------
1. Create local Debian repositories on [src] and [dest] instances.
2. Deploy any .deb (""A"") in [src] Debian repository.
3. Enable event replication from [src] Debian repository to [dest] Debian repository.
4. Deploy another .deb (""B"") in [src] Debian repository.
5. Wait for metadata calculation to complete on [src].
6. Package ""B"" and [src]'s metadata are replicated to [dest]. Metadata in [dest] will contain data for both packages ""A"" and ""B"" even though only ""B"" is in the repo. [dest] will never calculate its own metadata. It maintains the replicated metadata even though that data contains invalid information for the repo.

7. Install plugin to block Debian metadata replication (code below).
8. Deploy a 3rd .deb (""C"") in [src] Debian repository.
9. ""C"" is replicated, but metadata is blocked. No metadata is generated on [dest], so [dest]'s Debian repository now contains packages ""B"" and ""C,"" but metadata for ""A"" and ""B"".

10. Delete everything from both [src] and [dest] repositories. Metadata is rebuilt upon deletion. Refresh repos and delete that too, until both repositories are empty.
11. Deploy any .deb (""A"") to [src]
12. ""A"" is replicated to [dest], but no metadata is ever generated, so [dest] now only contains the single .deb file.

13. Empty the [dest] repository as in step 10.
14. Create a generic repository on [src].
15. Enable event replication from [src] generic repository to [dest] Debian repository.
16. Deploy a .deb artifact to [src] generic repository.
17. Since the generic repository has no metadata, only the .deb is pushed to [dest]. [dest] never generates metadata, giving the same result as in step 12.",CentOS Linux release 7.2.1511,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RTFACT-8886,,,,,"24/May/16 11:38 PM;joshuah;-.groovy;https://www.jfrog.com/jira/secure/attachment/19902/-.groovy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|hzrrqf:",,,,,,,UNCOVERED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To reproduce:

1. Create a new remote npm repo pointing to:

2. Cause the following dependency to get cached:
https://registry.npmjs.org/angular2-cookie/-/angular2-cookie-1.1.0.tgz

3. Note that the artifact shows up as 23542 in the Artifactory interface.

4. Try to retrieve the above dependency from Artifactory.

5. The following message appears in artifactory.log (for example):

2016-05-12 10:02:08,542 [http-nio-8080-exec-332] [WARN ] (o.a.r.ArtifactoryResponseBase:58) - Zero bytes sent to client but expected 23542 bytes.

This can be reproduced easier by creating a local repository, manually uploading the angular2-cookie-1.1.0.tgz artifact from the URL above to it, then trying to download it from Artifactory Pro 4.7.6.  You should see the retrieval stall and/or eventually time out and/or give you a zero-byte file.  We tested this via Chrome browser, curl and npm.

The following good artifact does not exhibit the issue:

In some organizations, the administrator user is not a separate account, but belongs to a particular user. This allows traceability of actions back to a specific user, where a shared account creates a level of anonymity around who actually did a change.

In this case, I have found a need to indicate myself as the ""Owner"" of a permission target, by granting myself ""Manage"" access. This is a form of documentation, where if you want to see who is responsible for a particular Permission Target, you can look to see who has ""Manage"" access.

Artifactory does not seem allow this via the UI. I am unable to search for my user account in the search screen, in order to add myself with ""Manage"" access.

I was able to access the Security configuration from the XML, and manually add myself. But, this seems complicated, error-prone and dangerous. I did it to clearly show which Permission Target I am responsible for (as opposed to another Artifactory administrator who might have a different set of Permission Target that they are responsible for)..

I do notice then after manually adding myself - ""Manage"" is checked but disabled, so I am unable to reduce my access. While this technically makes sense from the perspective that disabling it would make no difference in terms of effective access right now at this moment. I might not always be an Artifactory administrator. I could move onto another job within the company and somebody could step into my role. In this case, I would prefer to define my access correctly according to what access I should have for a particular set of data, and the fact that I am also an Artifactory administrator should be more of an incidental fact only discovered at the point of time that it is checked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2|hzrnlr:",,,,,,,UNCOVERED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

* [Git for Windows|https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases]
* [Docker Toolbox| https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases]
* [Tini| https://github.com/krallin/tini/releases]

On the advanced settings page for the remote repo select ""Bypass HEAD Requests "" and Save.

Now you can download and (binary) files like release artifacts by replacing ""https://github.com/"" in the url with ""<your-artifactory-base-url>/github/"", e.g. https://github.com/schneidexe/tpl/releases/download/v0.4.5/tpl-linux-amd64 becomes http://artifactory.local/artifactory/github/schneidexe/tpl/releases/download/v0.4.5/tpl-linux-amd64

I would strongly recommend this feature, as my Jenkins users cannot download their massive amount of files at the same time. Our Artifactory configuration has the ""download folders"" setting turned off due to the large repo's we don't want users to download. However if this setting was at a repository level, where users had the ability to download any folder within a repository, that would remove the need to upload everything in compressed files. Would love to see this happen as our millions of artifacts are transferred over to Artifactory!

I just want to add a comment on this ticket.
If the resquest from rundeck (to artifactory) is made with ""Accept: application/json"", the response have to contain the header : ""Content-Type: application/json"".
If not, the response will be ignored by rundeck.

So, it would be great if the groovy can modify the ""Content-type"" header placed in the response. Or at least, having the header set to the content-type requested at first (if the ""Accept"" does not contain multiples values).",,,,,,

Issues:

- Using the next/previous buttons on the browser search scrolls to the wrong location in the logs and the term is not highlighted when scrolled to, forcing you to add/delete a letter in your search term to re-highlight.

When setting up a proxy repository using Nexus, there is this missing feature:
https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/NEXUS-9360

We are using Artifactory to track both internal and publicly available artifacts.
In our case we would be keen on hiding the presence of the internal artifacts and yet still allow the public to mirror our repositories using Nexus.

Consider the following

1. foo-common-1.0.jar is a 20mb jar built and deployed to artifactory
2. foo-webapp is a war which includes foo-common-1.0.jar and is deployed to artifactory
3. foo-application is a zip which includes foo-common-1.0.jar and is deployed to artifactory
4. there are 10 versions of foo-webapp and 10 versions of foo-application

This means that in artifactory there will be 21 copies of foo-common-1.0.jar (once for the artifact itself and another 10 embedded into each zip/war version). If foo-common-1.0.jar is a large artifact this can start to chew through disk space pretty quickly.

Artifactory by it's very nature is prone to redundancy / duplication in this way with many wars, zips and ears embedding the exact same jars. 

If artifactory were 'smarter' about disk usage it could inspect artifacts as they are uploaded and inspect them for duplications and store the artifacts in some pointer based file system. When artifacts are retrieved from artifactory, it could piece them back together making sure to check sha1 checksums before and after the 'smartness' is applied.

If this feature were to be implemented, artifactory could provide the exact same functionality as it does today but with drastically reduced disk space requirements, possibly at the cost of a slower response time (I'm sure caching could help here).

Please note that my actual use case involves hundreds of teams which share the foo-common-1.0.jar

Desired behavior:

If property set is assigned to repo it should be able to enforce those settings, i.e.

multi value can only be set to one or more out of pre configured list of values.

Can error messages either appear somewhere more obvious, or not disappear until manually acknowledged? 

Suggestions:
- Errors appear in a focal place that the user will pay attention to: near the upload progress bar or the 'deploy' button
- Errors persist until the user clicks to acknowledge them
- Errors grey out the 'deploy' button to make it clear there was a problem with an upload, and that it's not just that site isn't responding

like special API inside artifactory to tag it, so we can use it for own CI job to upload and mark it.

https://github.com/JFrogDev/artifactory-user-plugins/blob/master/config/getAndSetP2Url.groovy
This plugin will enable you to overcome the version issues by executing cURL commands. In order to deploy this plugin you’ll need to copy this plugin into $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc/plugin. In addition you’ll need to set up $ARTIFACTORY_HOME/etc/artifactory.system.properties to load the plugin by setting artifactory.plugin.scripts.refreshIntervalSecs to a value greater than 0.

This plugin supports two commands: 
getP2Urls - returns the current P2 settings in your artifactory. the cURL command to execute this is: curl 

-uadmin:password -X POST ""http://localhost:8081/artifactory/api/plugins/execute/getP2Urls?params=repo=repoKey""   Set the value of repoKey to the name of your P2 virtual repository. 
modifyP2Urls - Will modify the P2 according to the version set up in the json file. 
An example to a json file could be:
{
""repo"": ""p2-virtual"",""urls"": [
         ""http://dl.google.com/eclipse/plugin/3.7"",
         ""http://download.eclipse.org/releases/luna"",
         ""http://download.eclipse.org/mylyn/releases/luna"",

""local://p2-local/eclipse-repository/eclipse-repository/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/eclipse-repository-1.0.0-20141213.002711-2.zip!/""
]
}

The cURL command would be:

curl -uadmin:password -T /path/to/jsonFile  -X POST ""http://localhost:8081/artifactory/api/plugins/execute/modifyP2Urls""

Moving an artifact in the tree browser view resets the entire folder hierarchy view when move completes,RTFACT-6923,26242,Improvement,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,smuskiew,smuskiew,04/Nov/14 5:49 PM,07/Jan/21 3:10 PM,18/Feb/21 8:56 AM,,3.5.3,,,,,Web UI,,,,,0,,,,,,,,"If I use the Artifactory web UI repository browser view and navigate through the folder hierarchy (expanding multiple levels of folders in the process) to select an artifact to move an artifact to another repository, when the move action completes, the folder view in the repository browser is reset (to the default?) view, ie. all folders are closed as if I had clicked the ""Artifacts"" tab.

This can be a real nuisance when moving multiple artifacts as each time I need to expand the same folders in the tree again to find the next artifact to move.

It would be nice if Artifactory would just keep the existing view once the move action completes (OK if you need to close up the one folder that it was moved from, but please don't close up all the parent folders as well!)

Please update the error message in the log to be less confusing. If there is a large number of valid packages being pulled down in parallel, the debug message is lost in the noise of other successful remote queries. Additionally, if debug is not turned on, the the error has no real info as to what is calling it with all the ""null"" parameters. Tracking this down is additionally difficult since the order which the nuget packages are restored is non-deterministic; if builds fail to finish, their nuget restores at different points.

Artifactory lacks the ability to populate the disk cache (~/.groovy/grapes or etc/plugin/lib) in advance.The embedded Groovy ignores @GrabResolver, which is undocumented. ~/.groovy/grapeConfig.xml is the recommended way to deal with that. 

~/.groovy/grapeConfig.xml can point to localhost to resolve through the Artifactory itself, but it causes deadlocks, especially when Artifactory uses a proxy. Suggest splitting the plugin registration process in two steps, first upload the plugin, resolving the dependencies and populating the cache, then activating the plugin upon restart and resolving the dependencies from cache. Artifactory could be configured to scan etc/plugin, but it is not recommended in production and upload is a more elegant solution. Upload can check and copy grapeConfig.xml if needed. 

The embedded Groovy may have problems when @Grapes find dependencies that are already included in Artifactory itself. Should provide ivy.xmls for jars included in Artifactory and add configuration to grapeConfig.xml so that modules corresponding to libraries in Artifactory are always resolved to the Artifactory distro. Artifactory should use <modules> in <ivysettings> to set a filesystem <resolver> that points to libraries in Artifactory so that Ivy in Grapes will be aware of them.

we'll see this in the error log:

2014-08-11 17:33:08,863 [qtp1413053480-81] [ERROR] (o.a.w.w.p.b.p.BuildBrowserRootPage:368) - An error occurred during the browsing of build info: Could not find builds by name 'curvebob_reporting-materialized-views-component'

This causes our alerting infrastructure to page our oncall operations folks.","11/Aug/14 5:38 PM;kingfai;As a workaround for now, is there a pattern in the logs which tell us that it is a UI error so that we can adjust our alerting infrastructure to ignore it?

","12/Aug/14 4:24 PM;kingfai;Here is another example that is giving us false alerts:

Subject: Re: [#22934] Is this a UI error?

Hi Albert,

Indeed it is looks like a harmless UI error where the file cannot be listed by wicket since the file has already been deleted (which is ok).

Hi JFrog,

Can you tell from the log if this is a UI error? I haven’t been able to reproduce this error unfortunately. 

From access.log, it seems like someone deleted an artifact:
2014-08-11 23:23:15,456 [ACCEPTED DELETE] maven-local-snapshot:com/yahoo/yamas/config-reader/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/config-reader-0.0.1-20140811.231440-3-javadoc.jar for _system_.

Then we see the following error in artifacatory.log:

The important difference to note is that Artifact Virtual Search supports virtual repo, but Checksum Search does not.  I tested this empirically with Artifactory 3.0.2, and the documentation is correct.

As with RTFACT-6661, this seems like a very odd difference between two search operations.  I don't know which is ""right"", but it seems to me like it ought to be consistent.  At least in this case (unlike in that case), the difference is documented.

Both Move Item and Copy Item generally return a 200, and express badness through WARNING and ERROR ""messages"" in the JSON.  I think this is arguably justified for several reasons:

* move and copy can be recursive, and some operations can pass, and others can fail.  HTTP status codes don't adequately allow for the addressing of partial failures
* move and copy can execute operations that pass, but deserve special attention via warnings.  HTTP status codes allow for the communication of errors, but not warnings.

This is a fairly common concept, e.g. on linux, tools such as curl and wget observe no_proxy environment variable. All browsers also have this option.

Detailed reasoning below:

We are using artifactory to proxy python pypi packages via a third party tool called pypi_redirect. This tool intercepts request for pip packages and translates them by sending a http redirect (302) back to the caller (artifactory). So in summary, artifacotory needs to talk to both http://localhost:9292/ and htttp://pypi.python.org/

Now, since we are behind a corporate web proxy, we need to tell artifactory about the proxy so it can reach http://pypi.python.org/. However, by doing this, it can't talk to http://localhost:9292 because it it trying to reach it by going through the proxy. There are ways to get around this but it is non-optimal. It would be better if you could just define a bypass rule instead.

Of course, an even better solution is for artifactory to be able to support proxing pypi repositories natively so we don't need to resort to third party tools!

Many thanks

We have a mix of remote repo's both on the Internet and our Intranet. For the Internet we must have the proxy, for the Intranet it's unnecessary (it works for most but it's much slower than going directly). We must have a system default proxy or search in remote repo;s doesn't work.

Another solution would be to not retroactively apply this proxy, but having this new feature would be great as well, since the number of Intranet domain names is limited and we don't have to remember when we do or don't have to use a proxy.

howto get/delete a build using build_number and started with rest API,RTFACT-6338,24619,Improvement,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,nicolas.dely@technicolor.com,nicolas.dely@technicolor.com,19/Feb/14 5:41 PM,04/Jan/21 5:10 PM,18/Feb/21 8:56 AM,,2.6.6,,,,,REST API,,,,,0,,,,,,,,"Hi,

I believe the uniq id of a build was build_name + build_number however in jenkins for example, when build_number is reset to a lesser existing number, it happens several builds have same build_number, it can look like that

GET /api/build/wicket
{
    ""uri"": ""http://localhost:8080/artifactory/api/build/wicket""
    ""buildsNumbers"" : [
    {
        ""uri"" : ""/51"",
        ""started"" : ISO8601 (<date1>)
    },
    {
        ""uri"" : ""/51"", <= same build number
        ""started"" : ISO8601 (<date2>)
    }
]
}

so the 2 builds can be identified thanks to started time, in web interface
this is webapp/builds/<build_name>/<build_number>/<date1 url encoded>/

but is it possible to identify them using rest API?

BuildInfo and deleteBuild support <build_number> not but started date, so when it happens it delete or return the newest first

it could be good to support <build_name>/<build_number>/?started=<date url encoded>

"Add support for ""Content-Disposition"" to the ""PUT"" concerning file uploads.",RTFACT-6314,24586,Improvement,Open,RTFACT,Artifactory Binary Repository,software,yanivs,The Universal Repository Manager,http://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/,4 - Normal,,,kwilczynski,kwilczynski,10/Feb/14 2:53 PM,15/Jul/19 11:21 PM,18/Feb/21 8:56 AM,,3.1.0,,,,,REST API,,,,,1,artifactory,artifacts,rest,,,,,"Hello,

At the moment, the ""PUT"" method handling implemented by the RESTful API layer does not support file uploads when the ""Content-Type"" is set to be ""multipart/form-data"" and relevant ""Content-Disposition"" header is preset. This is often true, when an underlying HTTP library (and a lot of them do it) send a file to the remote server using aforementioned approach, instead of just streaming the content of the file (performing rather a crude ""PUT"" to the server.

Lack of support in such a case causes all the extra information related to the ""Content-Type: multipart/form-data"" and ""Content-Disposition: form-data"" (namely the boundary details and content MIME type, etc) being saved as part of the artefact itself corrupting its content in due process.

For example, given the following upload example:

As can be seen above, extra information was saved alongside rest of the content.

It would be of a great help of Artifactory would support ""Content-Type: multipart/form-data"" and utilise boundary information from within the ""Content-Disposition"" header to correctly save the payload.

Thank you for help and all the hard work in advance!

I suggest the following approach:
  - Generate a key pair, the private key being encrypted (with PBE) using the user password (or let the user import it).
  - Generate some random token
  - Generate a signature on the token, using the private key. The user would do this on his profile page (since the current password is already required, this would allow to unlock/decrypt the private key and sign the data).
  - The user has to copy the signature as the ""encrypted"" password, similarly to what he does with a ""{DESede}"" password.

When the user tries to log in with his encrypted password, the following is done: 
  - the encrypted password, which is in fact a signature, is checked against the token and the public key. 

Benefits:
  - The private key of the user is stored encrypted and cannot be compromised easily even if the attacker has access to the server hosting Artifactory.
  - Only the token and the user public key are used for verification.

I added code examples as a small maven project.

## filesystem - binaries are stored in the filesystem (recommended, default)
## fullDb     - binaries are stored as blobs in the db, filesystem is used for caching
## cachedFS   - binaries are stored in the filesystem, but a front cache (with faster access) is added

And lastly, Frederic,  May I suggest just for the benefit of your brand and software, to invest into a Windows installer -- something created with InstallShield that takes an admin or evaluator through the first steps of installing and configuring your software.  The frustration you save to the person that evaluates your soft for the first time will turn into real dollars when the prospective client does not walk away from the frustration of setting things up.",,,,,

""OK, now I see what you mean. Currently the REST API does not expose a query that returns you an answer whether some path is a file or a folder. Here's what you can do:
1. Open a JIRA request for it.
2. In a meanwhile you can implement isFolder(repoPath) on the repositoryHandle by calling the File List request without listing the folders to determine whether the requested path is present in the list or not (if present - file, if not - folder).""

For an ssh proxy, I need to query for an item and get basic details about it.
Right now, I end up making 2 rest calls, one for a file and one for a folder combined with isFolder to determine if the object exists, and what type of object it is.

Using a httpclient based artifactory client, I am able to call:

http://test.artifactory/artifactory/api/storage/areese-ssh-proxy-test/com/yahoo/dps/sshd/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/maven-metadata.xml

or:
http://test.artifactory/artifactory/api/storage/areese-ssh-proxy-test/com/yahoo/dps/sshd/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/

and parse the resulting json to decide if it's a file or a folder.
The important things attributes I care about are:

children
created
lastModified
lastUpdated
repo
size
uri

I need children because if it's a folder, I want to be able to list the children.

I'm trying to move off of our home built artifactory client, and with the exception of this bump it's working.

- It is easier to check all backup messages, because I must not pick them up between all other artifactory log messages.
- When I restore the backup and find some problems (e.g.: missing artifacts or missing build information) I can check in the backup log file, whether there occured already problems during the backup, or whether these problems are related to restore.

- I need to have a file (the user plugin itself or a config file) to keep the name and port of the server (unless of course there is a variable that contains this info)

Now we try to promote the 2nd build. This however fails because it asks for DELETE permissions for because it needs to overwrite the apache common artifact.

* I don't want our deploy user to have delete permissions
* I don't want anything in our release repo to be deleted (ever), I only want files to be added.

Hence my suggesion: Add an option (or make this default) to skip an dependency copy if it already exists in that repository. I don't really see a reason why you would delete and deploy it again anyway?

All in all it would certainly help if one could open the aggregated p2 repository URL and be able to browse or view the p2 content.

Is it possible to have the default selection for ""Build Tool"" be set to another value then ""Maven""?

--- below is also a reply from the support regarding this topic:

The logic behind the dependency declaration panel is:
1. We search for the last selected tool by a cookie - if found, we use it.
2. If no cookie is found - we try to ""guess"" the build tool according to the repository layout (maven=maven-2-default, ivy=ivy-default, gradle=gradle-default).

So if you are using a custom layout we are not able to guess it and falling back to maven.

We run Artifactory's authantication via LDAP.
We have a password policy to force the users to change their passwords in regular periods.
We force password encryption in Artifactory.
We recognized, that the encrypted password is stored in Artifactory's database and if a user authenticates it is just checked against the ecncrypted form. Sadly if a user changes his password in LDAP the ""old"" encrypted password still works in Artifactory.
- Well, it seems it is newly generated if you log in via web-UI
- But most users just start their maven scripts and don't use the webinterface and thus can log in via ""old"" login
- Using the REST-API is also possibly with old encrypted pw.

You may implement a check where it looks into LDAPS ""last password change"" for that account and compares it to the users last login to Artifactory - and force rebuild of encrypted password if there is possibly a new one.

Artifactory allows for setting metadata recursively at the repository level, but this only applies to files that are already present in that repository.  In other words, the recursive setting isn't ""sticky"" -- it doesn't apply to newly added files.

I'd like semantics here that express ""every file in this repository will be filtered (or have whatever bit of metadata), immediately on deployment"".  Feasible?

Better would be to force a 401 challenge for all filtered files.  This allows for keeping the repository as open and discoverable as possible.  I actually want our internal users to see our 'gradle-init-scripts' repository, even if they aren't authenticated.  But if they try to grab one of the files (say, via wget), I don't want them to end up with unfiltered resources, which will just lead to confusion.

I've tried to restore a sub-tree of a repo, just to restore one lost module. I can select the correct path from the backup via the UI, but then the module is imported into the root of the repo and not under the correct sub directory.

My feature request is that the Artifactory import code should compute the relative directory by looking at the input path and scanning for its repo-root. For example, if I am restoring from:

   /X/repositories/libs-releases-local/netflix/platform

into repo libs-releases-local, currently all the version directories end up a the top of the repo. The imported should figure out that they should really be placed under netflix/platform by computing that from: /X/repositories/<srcrepo>/<relativepath>.

If one user gets hold of the encrypted password of another user, that user can potentially login into artifactory using the encrypted password of the other user and since the session would be an SSO session, they can potentially navigate to all the applications as the other user. 

They way user 1 can login using the encrypted password is by going to a repo url directly like
{code}
http://maven.ourdomain.com/artifactory/some-repo
{code}

If you navigate to the above url, then artifactory prompts for a username and encrypted password. Once entered, the user is completely logged in instead of just being able to browse the repository.

For an SSO enabled artifactory, this means the user can navigate to any other SSO enabled application.

The way the mirrorOf part is defined breaks one approach we use for project-specific libraries that are not available in a repository. We sometimes create a local repository in a library folder inside the project and then declare this as a repository using a file URL. This means we can manage the dependency both via Maven and as a part of the project.

The fix for this is to mirror only external repository (excluding localhost and file URLs), i.e. the segment above should read:

{code}
  <mirrors>
    <mirror>
      <mirrorOf>external:*</mirrorOf>

The approval process gives management an opportunity to validate that the license is compatible, to question its role, and to question whether it is the best solution to adopt compared to alternatives. Once approved, it is added to the corporate Maven repository and is then available to developers. 
 
Artifactory would be useful in managing the corporate Maven repository. However, the proxy needs to be restricted such that certain projects (preferably by version number) are available, and not just anything from ibiblio, for example, is available.

The process is like:
# Developer requests that open source project XYZ is added to the Corporate Maven Repository.
# Development Manager will approve the open source project, and so enables Artifactory to proxy this particular project (and its dependencies) from its source repository.  I think the following would need to be specified:
#* Source Repository:  _Default Maven (Ibiblio)_ [http://www.ibiblio.org/maven2]
#* groupId, artifactId
#* version range (optional).  For example:  \[1.5,)  specifies that versions prior to 1.5 are not accepted.
# Developer updates the pom.xml with the new dependency, and Artifactory proxies it.

This process might seem annoying, but if you are in an environment subject to internal audits, auditors like to see a process with procedures in place chock-full of safeguards.
